INTRO

The real question of course is: Does online
advertising work?
Unfortunately, it's impossible to give a
simple

answer

to

this

apparently

straightforward question. For starters, this is
not a single question, but at least three
diﬀerent ones, as we shall see. The right
question to ask would be: for whom does
online advertising work?
But even before we try to answer this
question, we need to deﬁne what we're talking
about:

banner

ads;

not

classified ads.
7

search

ads,

nor

Then we need to ask ourselves how online
advertising started, what it was supposed to be
like, if it worked out as advertised, why it went
astray, why it's still around, what it has
become etc.
Let's get started.

8

1. WHY BANNER ADS?

Why were banner ads introduced in the
ﬁrst

place,

starting

with

the

infamous

1994 AT&T banner ad on Wired.com that said:
“Have you ever clicked your mouse right
HERE? YOU WILL!”? [1]
Because

advertising

was

the

easiest business model for a web startup to
implement, and the easiest to market to
investors.

There's

advertising

in

the

newspaper, right? And in magazines. So you
have this new medium with a lot of words and
a modicum, back then, of images. What do
you do? You stick your company's logo in a
coloured rectangle and you're done!
9

Web startups could sign a deal with an ad
network, forget about sales and focus on
building

an

audience.

If

revenues

were

insuﬃcient to cover the costs, which was the
rule, it didn't matter because the mantra was
that a site with millions of users would surely
ﬁnd a way to generate revenue sometime in
the future. The later, the better [2].
At least until the Bubble burst.

10

2. WHAT WAS ONLINE
ADVERTISING SUPPOSED
TO BE LIKE?

Online advertising was supposed to be
wonderful, new, and exciting. But most of all,
interactive! The idea was that, for reasons
which I have yet to understand, people would
want to “interact” with banner ads. Thus the
IAB, or Interactive (not Internet, mind you)
Advertising Bureau, was born.
My ﬁrst question is: why in the world
would you want anybody to “interact with
your ads”? Wasn’t the goal of advertising to
convince people to buy your bloody product?
11

Second question: do you interact with TV
ads? I usually head up and go to the bathroom.
Why in the world would it be any diﬀerent
online, when I’m completing an important
task or doing something that interests me and
not just killing time in front of the dumb
screen? [3]

12

3. DID IT WORK OUT AS
ADVERTISED?

No. Nobody wanted to “interact”. Nobody
even clicked.
What
advertising”

was
is

once
now

called
called

“interactive
“display

advertising”, i.e. advertising nobody “interacts”
with. The average click rate on banner ads
is around 0.1%, or one in a thousand, and less
than half that little for the old format, the
468×60 banner ad [4].
It’s pretty crude but, if you believe what
Solve Media says, you are much more likely to
survive a plane crash than to click on a banner
13

ad [5].
To add insult to injury, those who do click
are a small number of people who account for
a disproportionate amount of clicks: 8 percent
of Internet users account for 85 percent of
clicks. And guess what? It's mostly the poor
and the uneducated who click on banner ads.
Were

those

the

people

"target"? [6]

14

you

wanted

to

4. WHY NOT?

The days of the ridiculous banner ad
barter exchange networks and of websites that
used banner ads to promote areas or features
of their own websites whenever nobody
bought an ad placement are long gone, and
not missed.
But still: how many web pages do you
browse in a day? There's at least a banner ad
on every single page, and sometimes more
than one.
Why

were

web

users

–

that

is,

us – expected to interact with all these things
in large numbers? Somebody should explain
to those who work in advertising that users are
15

not half as entertained as they are about the
product

of

their

work,

especially

if

it's delivered in a poor format like banner ads
and with sub-par creativity. Did they really
think that we had nothing better to do online?
Think again.

16

5. WHY ARE BANNER ADS
STILL AROUND?

Banner

ads

have

shown

remarkable

staying power as a format, especially if you
consider

how

performed.
Because

badly

they

have

under-

Why

are

they

still

around?

nobody

had

the

guts

or

the

imagination to come up with something better
and smarter.
Sure, the IAB made them bigger, and
standardised the sizes, but the format itself
was never questioned [7].
What happened instead was a furious race
to extract at least some value out of this waste
17

land, out of these billions of banner ads that
laid

bare

and

Aﬃliate

Adsense,

then

unsold

a er

the

then

Google's

targeting,

retargeting, search retargeting etc.
No matter how improved the targeting,
click-through rates remain abysmal.

18

6. IS ALL THIS TARGETING
GOOD?

No, it's not.
If it were good, Apple wouldn't say with
pride that Safari is "the ﬁrst browser to block
these cookies by default", would they? Apple
could easily implement more tracking than
other browsers. Why don’t they? Why doesn’t
Apple’s browser “help you connect and share
with your favorite brands”? [8]
Let me tell you why it's not good from a
simple

business

perspective:

because

the

breach of privacy and the abuse of trust is
increasingly resented, and more resented the
19

more

consumers

understand

how

it

works [9] ; and as a result, ad-blocking so ware
being more widespread than anti-tracking
so ware,

people

decide

to

block

ads

altogether.
In 2014, 41% of Americans under the age of
30 used AdBlock to block out ads [10].

20

7. IS THIS ADVERTISING AT
ALL?

No, not really.
In the days before brand became a verb,
and more speciﬁcally something you do to
manipulate consumers, advertisers invested
large amounts of money to put their name in
front of large segments of the population.
Their promise to the world was fairly simple:
this is our product, it's great, it does this and
that and we are sure you'll love it! [11]
From the days of Don Peppers and Martha
Rogers's The One to One Future, it's been a race
to get your company to speak with (actually:
21

to) the individual consumer. Success, however,
has been bittersweet. An audience of one is not
an

audience. With

promise

to

the

no

audience

and

no

wider

public,

it's

not

advertising anymore [12].
It's

just

direct

marketing

on

steroids

fuelled by tracking that would have put the
KGB – or the NSA – to shame.

22

8. HOW BIG IS THIS
THING?

It's huge.
According to Comscore, a staggering 5.3
trillion display ads impressions were delivered
in the U.S. in 2012, with Q4 seeing the most at
1.4 trillion – up 6 percent from 2011. AT&T
ranked as the #1 advertiser with 104.8 billion
ad impressions. Microsoft came in second with
47.4 billion impressions. No fewer than 445
diﬀerent advertisers delivered more than a
billion banner ads in 2012 [13].
In 2014, display ads were expected to be
worth

about

50

billion
23

USD

worldwide,

or about 10% of the total global ad spend [14].
Which is amazing for a format which was
presented as a revolution, failed utterly and
ended up becoming creepy direct marketing
of the worst kind which fails publishers and
advertisers alike and antagonises consumers.

24

9. WHAT IS
PROGRAMMATIC?

Programmatic is a set of technologies that
automate

the

buying,

placement,

and

optimisation of media inventory in the digital
space: display ads, video ads, and mobile
ads [15].
Programmatic

advertising

technology

promises to make the ad buying system
quicker

and

more

eﬃcient:

it

allows

advertisers to buy guaranteed ad impressions
in advance from speciﬁc publisher sites, and
it allows publishers to sell ad space via realtime auctions, with real-time bidding (RTB).

25

While RTB has historically been associated
with remnant inventory, the technology is
now applied to a wider range of inventory. Or,
as I like to say, it's (almost) all remnant
inventory: Advertising on the web has become
the reign of large-scale, low-quality direct
response that buys ad space anywhere it can
find it and judges it just by the results.

26

10. DOES ONLINE
ADVERTISING WORK FOR
PUBLISHERS?

No, it doesn't.
In the move from analog to digital,
publishers are getting digital pennies [16] for
the analog advertising dollars they used to
make.
Why? First, because “online advertising” is
direct marketing, and direct marketers are
pretty

stingy

with

their

money.

Second,

because the vast improvements in targeting
mean that they can ﬁnd the users they want
27

on any site; it's not necessary to pay more to
show their ads on sites with good content or a
good reputation.
Lastly,

because

there

are

so many intermediaries taking a cut in the
targeting war on consumers [17] that, according
to

Tim Armstrong,

between

25%

and

CEO
45%

of AOL,
of

the

money

spent makes it as far as the publishers [18].

28

only

11. DOES IT WORK FOR
ADVERTISERS?

Not as "advertising".
As Bob Hoﬀman says: "Please show me a
company that was able to create a brand with
online advertising" [19].
It's direct marketing, except that a direct
marketer will attribute a sale only if there's a
direct

and

demonstrable

link

from

his

eﬀort to the sale. But what happens when you
try

to

attribute

a

sale

to

a

type

of

advertising in which a carefully executed
branding banner ad gets fewer clicks than a
blank, empty white one? [20]
29

When

you

start

pretending

that

a

consumer was "inﬂuenced” by a banner ad he
or she never clicked on, but fail to do the same
with the big money spent on print, radio or
TV ads, or with the fact that certain brands are
very powerful and worth billions, or with the
fact that their merchandise is shown in stores,
we have a problem [21].

30

12. DOES IT WORK FOR THE
MIDDLEMEN?

You bet it does!
That's why they are pushing it! With the
notable exception of Apple, this is Silicon
Valley's

new

business

model

of

choice! Following Google's incredible success,
even Microso , a company that did pretty
well

selling

so ware,

set

up

entire

divisions – think about Bing, or Windows
Mobile – based on the idea that the future
would be ad-supported.
One of the problems is precisely that it is
Silicon

Valley's

business
31

model.

It

has become a tech thing: it's all about targeting
and results and large-scale number-crunching.
Creativity

and

wit

don't

count

a

thing

anymore.
The other problem is that it doesn't work.
But this is a great opportunity for Silicon
Valley to sell companies more services to
target, slice and dice, or to trick people into
thinking that it's all fine.

32

13. IS IT A GIGANTIC
SCAM?

Well, there are plenty of small and large
scams.
In November, 2014, Google reported that
56% of the display ads were "not viewable" [22].
Comscore reports very similar numbers [23].
So let's put it this way: yes, it is very opaque to
say the least, and you should be careful.
But the real problem is that the banner ad
is a poor format that was sold to us as gold
(interactive advertising) when in fact it is toxic
lead,

low-quality

direct

marketing

which

works only thanks to the extreme tracking of
33

users' habits that is increasingly resented.
And, even so, it "works", or gives you the
impression of working, only if you bend the
rules of direct marketing and start counting
the "inﬂuence" a banner ad nobody clicked on
may have had on a successive sale. This is the
real scam.

34

14. SHOULD MY COMPANY
STAY AWAY FROM BANNER
ADS?

If you are a startup, do whatever it takes.
You have no brand to compromise, and you
could well be dead within 6 months' time, so
go ahead. If for some strange reason banner
ads bring you the right users at the right price,
go for it!
If,

on

the

other

hand,

you

are

an

established company, do you really want to do
low-level direct marketing which o en upsets
your customers just because you are told you
should?
35

Instead,

ask

yourself

some

hard questions: Would you advertise on
dubious newspapers or magazines? Would you
buy ads without knowing where they are going
to run? Would you place TV ads late at night
and in the company of shady advertisers?
Why not? Because the places where you
advertise and the other advertisers in whose
company you advertise do matter.

36

15. IS THERE ANY HOPE
FOR ONLINE ADVERTISING?

Meaning: Can parts of the web remain free
and supported by quality online advertising,
advertising companies can feel comfortable
buying, advertising that could actually help
them and advertising that could pay the bills
for publishers?
Probably not, if you ask me.
Don Marti, however, has an interesting
contrarian idea which is worth exploring:
serious publishers should tell their readers
how badly they are being tracked, opt-out of
the scheme and insist that their readers do the
37

same by installing anti-tracking so ware that
would make it impossible for advertisers to
target them on dubious websites, thus forcing
advertisers to go back to the old ways of
having to spend good money it they want to
reach an interesting audience on a quality
website. Will it work? [24]
