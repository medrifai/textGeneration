The credit system, which has its focal point in the allegedly national
banks and the big money-lenders and usurers that surround them, is
one enormous centralization and gives this class of parasites a fabulous
power not only to decimate the industrial capitalists periodically but
also to interfere in actual production in the most dangerous manner—
and this crew know nothing of production and have nothing at all to
do with it.
— Marx, Capital, vol. 3, chap. 33

I’m not a parasite. I’m an investor.
— Lyonya Gulubkov, described by the New York Times as “a bumbling
Russian Everyman” responding to “Soviet-style” taunts in an ad for the
fraudulent MMM investment scheme which collapsed in 1994

Though one name usually appears on the cover, a book is a far more
collaborative project than that. I’ve enjoyed splendid research assistance
from (in chronological order) Michael Tremonte, who gathered most of
the material found in the bibliography; Kim Phillips; Lisa Westberg; Josh
Mason, who assembled lots of last-minute articles and numbers; Adria
Scharf; and Shana Siegel. Thanks to Jean Bratton for reading the proofs.
Thanks too to all the sources, named and unnamed. For all the faults of
American society, I’ve long been amazed at its openness; both publicand private-sector sources are almost always happy to help an author out.
Thanks as well to my cyber-colleagues in two computer networks, the
Progressive Economists Network and Post-Keynesian Thought (for information on both, visit http://csf.colorado.edu), and to my real-life friends
Patrick Bond, Bob Fitch, Dan Lazare, John Liscio, Bob Pollin, and Gregg
Wirth. Deep expressions of gratitude are also due to three editors: Ben
Sonnenberg of Grand Street and Victor Navasky of The Nation, who gave
me a public forum when my newsletter was young and little more than a
vanity operation, and Colin Robinson of Verso, who not only offered me a
book contract when I was even more obscure than I am now, but who
also put up with my endless delays in getting this thing done.
Thanks, along with love, to my parents, Harold and Victorine Henwood,
for a lifetime of support of every kind, and to Christine Bratton, my companion and partner in life and in many aspects of work as well. Chris has
not only spent a decade reading and improving my prose, but she put up
with me as I wrote this book. For years, I thought that authors’ expressions of gratitude for indulgence from intimates were mere boilerplate,
but when I think back on what a cranky, preoccupied monster I was for
nearly six years (not to mention the brief paperback relapse), I now realize just how deeply felt they were. I’ll say once again that life would be
unimaginable without her.

Introduction

It’s rare that someone should develop an obsession with Wall Street without sharing its driving passion, the accumulation of money. It would probably take years of psychoanalysis to untangle that contradiction, not to
mention others too sensitive to name here.
No doubt that contradictory obsession has early roots, but its most potent adult influence was probably my first job out of college, at a small
brokerage firm in downtown Manhattan. The firm had been started by a
former Bell Labs physicist, who wanted to use his quantitative skills to
analyze and trade a then-new instrument known as listed options. The
refugee physicist was considerably ahead of his time; few people understood options in 1975, and fewer still were interested in using the kinds of
high-tech trading strategies that would later sweep Wall Street.
My title was secretary to the chairman, which meant not only that I
typed his letters, but also that I got his lunch and went out to buy him new
socks when he’d left his old ones in a massage parlor. And I studied the
place like an anthropologist, absorbing the mentality and culture of money.
It was fascinating in its own way, but it also struck me as utterly cynical
and empty, a profound waste of human effort.
One morning, riding the elevator up to work, I noticed a cop standing
next to me, a gun on his hip. I realized in an instant that all the sophisticated machinations that went on upstairs and around the whole Wall Street
neighborhood rested ultimately on force. Financial power, too, grows out
of the barrel of a gun. Of course a serious analysis of the political economy
of finance has to delve into all those sophisticated machinations, but the
image of that gun should be kept firmly in mind.
On what is loosely called the left, such as it is these days, two unhappy
attitudes towards modern finance prevail — one, the everything’s-changed1

WALL STREET

and-capital-no-longer-matters school, and two, a stance of uninformed
condemnation. An example of the first is this silly but representative eruption from Jean Baudrillard (1993, pp. 10–11, 33):
Marx simply did not foresee that it would be possible for capital, in the face
of the imminent threat to its existence, to transpoliticize itself, as it were: to
launch itself into an orbit beyond the relations of production and political
contradictions, to make itself autonomous in a free-floating, ecstatic and
haphazard form, and thus to totalize the world in its own image. Capital (if
it may still be so called) has barred the way of political economy and the
law of value; it is in this sense that it has successfully escaped its own end.
Henceforward it can function independently of its own former aims, and
absolutely without reference to any aims whatsoever…. Money is now the
only genuine artificial satellite. A pure artifact, it enjoys a truly astral mobility; and it is instantly convertible. Money has now found its proper place, a
place far more wondrous than the stock exchange: the orbit in which it
rises and sets like some artificial sun.

This isn’t that surprising from a writer who can declare the Gulf War a
media event. But it displays an understanding of finance apparently derived from capital’s own publicists, like George Gilder, who celebrate the
obsolescence of matter and the transcendence of all the old hostile relations of production. Cybertopians and other immaterialists are lost in a
second- or even third-order fetishism, unable to decode the relations of
power behind the disembodied ecstasies of computerized trading.
And, on the other hand, lefties of all sorts — liberal, populist, and socialist — who haven’t succumbed to vulgar postmodernism have continued the long tradition of beating up on finance, denouncing it as a stinkpot
of parasitism, irrelevance, malignancy, and corruption, without providing
much detail beyond that. Many critics denounce “speculation” as a waste
of social resources, without making any connections between it and the
supposedly more fundamental world of “production.” Sociologists who
study power structures write portentously of “the banks,” but their evidence is often vague and obsolete (see, for example, Glasberg 1989b, a
piece written at the end of one of the great financial manias of all time that
nonetheless relies heavily on evidence from the 1970s). It’s as if such people
stopped thinking and collecting evidence 20 or even 60 years ago.
This book is an attempt to get down and dirty with how modern American finance works and how it’s connected to the real world. It’s a system
that seems overwhelming at times — almost sublime in its complexity and
2

INTRODUCTION

power, reminiscent of Fredric Jameson’s (1991, pp. 39–44) reading of John
Portman’s Bonaventure Hotel, at once packed and empty, a spatial analogue of our disorientation as subjects in the dizzy world of modern multinational capitalism. (It seems especially dizzying as I write this in early
1998, with the U.S. stock market at or near its highest levels of valuation in
125 years, and the broad public the most deeply involved it’s been in
decades, and maybe ever.) As an antidote to that sense of disorientation,
Jameson suggested the need for “cognitive mapping,” critical expositions
of that vertiginous world that remind us that despite its vast scope, it is the
product of human intelligence and society, comprehensible with a little
effort, and maybe even transformable with a little more.
In a soundbite, the U.S. financial system performs dismally at its advertised task, that of efficiently directing society’s savings towards their optimal investment pursuits. The system is stupefyingly expensive, gives
terrible signals for the allocation of capital, and has surprisingly little to do
with real investment. Most money managers can barely match market averages — and there’s evidence that active trading reduces performance
rather than improving it — yet they still haul in big fees, and their brokers,
big commissions (Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny 1992). Over the long
haul, almost all corporate capital expenditures are internally financed,
through profits and depreciation allowances. And instead of promoting
investment, the U.S. financial system seems to do quite the opposite; U.S.
investment levels rank towards the bottom of the First World (OECD) countries, and are below what even quite orthodox economists — like Darrel
Cohen, Kevin Hassett, and Jim Kennedy (1995) of the Federal Reserve —
term “optimal” levels. Real investment, not buying shares in a mutual fund.
Take, for example, the stock market, which is probably the centerpiece
of the whole enterprise.1 What does it do? Both civilians and professional
apologists would probably answer by saying that it raises capital for investment. In fact it doesn’t. Between 1981 and 1997, U.S. nonfinancial
corporations retired $813 billion more in stock than they issued, thanks to
takeovers and buybacks. Of course, some individual firms did issue stock
to raise money, but surprisingly little of that went to investment either. A
Wall Street Journal article on 1996’s dizzying pace of stock issuance
(McGeehan 1996) named overseas privatizations (some of which, like
Deutsche Telekom, spilled into U.S. markets) “and the continuing restructuring of U.S. corporations” as the driving forces behind the torrent of
new paper. In other words, even the new-issues market has more to do
with the arrangement and rearrangement of ownership patterns than it
3

WALL STREET

does with raising fresh capital — a point I’ll return to throughout this book.
But most of the trading in the stock market is of existing shares, not
newly issued ones. New issues in 1997 totaled $100 billion, a record —
but that’s about a week’s trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange.2
One thing the financial markets do very well, however, is concentrate
wealth. Government debt, for example, can be thought of as a means for
upward redistribution of income, from ordinary taxpayers to rich bondholders. Instead of taxing rich people, governments borrow from them,
and pay them interest for the privilege. Consumer credit also enriches the
rich; people suffering stagnant wages who use the VISA card to make
ends meet only fatten the wallets of their creditors with each monthly
payment. Nonfinancial corporations pay their stockholders billions in annual dividends rather than reinvesting them in the business. It’s no wonder, then, that wealth has congealed so spectacularly at the top. Chapter 2
offers detailed numbers; for the purposes of this introduction, however, a
couple of gee-whiz factoids will do. Leaving aside the principal residence,
the richest 1/2 % of the U.S. population claims a larger share of national
wealth than the bottom 90%, and the richest 10% account for over threequarters of the total. And with that wealth comes extraordinary social power
— the power to buy politicians, pundits, and professors, and to dictate
both public and corporate policy.
That power, the subject of Chapter 6, is something economists often
ignore. With the vast increase of government debt since the Reagan experiment began has come an increasing political power of “the markets,”
which typically means cuts in social programs in the name of fiscal probity. Less visibly, the increased prominence of institutional investors, particularly pension funds, in the stock market has increased rentier power
over corporate policy. Though globalization and technology have gotten
most of the blame for the recent wave of downsizings, the prime culprits
are really portfolio managers demanding higher stock prices — a demand
that translates into layoffs and investment cutbacks. This growth in stockholder influence has come despite the fact that outside shareholders serve
no useful social purpose; they trade on emotion and perceptions of emotion, and know nothing of the businesses whose management they’re increasingly directing. They’re walking arguments for worker ownership.
This book concentrates almost entirely on American markets. That’s not
only for reasons of the author’s nationality, but also because the U.S. (and
British) financial system, with the central role it accords to loosely regu4

INTRODUCTION

lated stock and bond markets, has been spreading around the globe. Henry
Kaufman (1994) called this “the ‘Americanization’ of global finance.” The
World Bank and its comrades in the development establishment have urged
a stock-market-driven model of finance and corporate control on its client
countries in the Third World and the former socialist world, and the English-language business press is full of stories on how the Germans and
Japanese are coming to their senses, or have to if they know what’s good
for them, and junk their stodgy old regulated, bank-centered systems for a
Wall Street/City of London model. And all evidence is that they are, though
never quickly enough for the editorialists.
Also, the international financial markets, which Japanese and German
investors participate in, resemble the Anglo-Saxon system in all their looseness and speed. Finally, the stock market has become a kind of economic
ideal in the minds of neoliberal reformers everywhere: every market,
whether for airline tickets or human labor, has been or is being restructured to resemble the constantly fluid world of Wall Street, in which prices
float freely and arrangements are as impermanent as possible. For these
reasons, a study of the U.S. financial markets, particularly the stock market, could be of interest to an audience beyond those specifically curious
about the American way of financial life.
This book inhabits a strange world between journalism and scholarship: the first three chapters in particular look at the empirical realities of
the financial markets — the instruments traded and the agents doing the
trading — and then the fourth and fifth chapters look at some of the things
economists have said about finance over the past two centuries. I hope
that I’ve managed to bring the two normally separate worlds together in
an illuminating way, but of course the risk is that I’ll only succeed at alienating both the popular and the academic audience. It’s worth the risk.
Most financial journalism is innocent of any theoretical and historical perspective, and academic work — mainstream and radical — is often indifferent to daily practice.
I must confess that I am not a “trained” economist. For someone not
initiated into the priesthood, several years spent exploring the professional
literature can be a traumatic experience. One of the finest glosses on that
experience came long ago from, of all people, H.L. Mencken, in his essay
“The Dismal Science”: “The amateur of such things must be content to
wrestle with the professors, seeking the violet of human interest beneath
the avalanche of their graceless parts of speech. A hard business, I daresay,
to one not practiced, and to its hardness there is added the disquiet of a
5

WALL STREET

doubt.” That doubt, Mencken wrote — after conceding that in things economic he was about as orthodox as they come — was inspired by the fact
that the discipline
hits the employers of the professors where they live. It deals, not with ideas
that affect those employers only occasionally or only indirectly or only as
ideas, but with ideas that have an imminent and continuous influence upon
their personal welfare and security, and that affect profoundly the very foundations of that social and economic structure upon which their whole existence is based. It is, in brief, the science of the ways and means whereby
they have come to such estate, and maintain themselves in such estate, that
they are able to hire and boss professors.

Apostates, Mencken argued, were far more unwelcome in the field than in
others of less material consequence (like, say, literary studies).
There are few subspecialties of economics where this is truer than in
finance. The bulk of the finance literature consists of painfully fine-grained
studies designed for the owners and managers of money capital. Important matters, like whether the financial markets serve their advertised purpose of allocating social capital effectively, are studied with an infrequency
surprising only to someone unfamiliar with Mencken’s Law.
But the violet of interests is no longer hidden behind graceless parts of
speech alone; mathematics is now the preferred disguise. The dismal science now flatters itself with delusions of rigor — an elaborate statistical
apparatus built on the weakest of foundations, isolated from the other
social sciences, not to mention the broader culture, and totally dead to the
asking of any fundamental questions about the goals of either the discipline or the organization of economic life itself.
I do ask, and I hope answer, lots of those difficult questions, but I also
want to take on the dismal scientists on their own terms. For many nonspecialist readers, this may seem like heavy going. I’ve tried, wherever
possible, to isolate the heavily technical bits and plaster appropriately cautionary headlines on the dangerous sections. But too much writing these
days, and not only on the left, consists of anecdote, narrative, moralizing,
and exhortation. Even though both the financial markets and the discipline of economics have penetrated so deeply and broadly into much of
social life, these institutions remain largely immune to critical examination. The next 300 pages undertake that examination, and perhaps in more
detail than some readers might like, but I don’t ever want to lose sight of
this simple fact: behind the abstraction known as “the markets” lurks a set
6

INTRODUCTION

of institutions designed to maximize the wealth and power of the most
privileged group of people in the world, the creditor–rentier class of the
First World and their junior partners in the Third.
I’ve committed at least two commercial sins in writing this book —
one, the omission of practical investment advice, and two, going lightly
on scandal-mongering and naming of rotten apples. As penance for the
first, I’ll offer this bit of advice: forget about beating the market; it can be
done, but those who can do it are rare. And for the second: pointing to
rotten apples implies that the rest of the barrel is pure and refreshing. My
point is that the entire batch of apples is pretty poor nourishment. By this
I don’t mean to imply that everyone who works in finance is devious,
corrupt, or merely rapacious. There are many fine people who underwrite, analyze, trade, and sell securities; some of them are my friends and
neighbors. Their personal characteristics have nothing to do with what
follows. That’s the point of a systemic analysis — to take apart the institutions that are larger than the personalities who inhabit them.
Between the publication of the hardcover edition of this book and the
paperback, the U.S. stock market rose almost without interruption, to truly
extraordinary levels of valuation, the highest since modern records begin
in 1871. In the past, high valuations have been associated with nasty subsequent declines, but it’s always possible this is a new era, a Nirvana of
capital, in which the old rules don’t apply. If Social Security is privatized,
it could constitute an official stock price support mechanism.
Households — presumably mostly in the upper half of the income distribution — plunged into stocks (through the medium of mutual funds) in
a way not seen in 30, or maybe 70, years. At the same time, households —
presumably poorer ones than the mutual fund buyers — have also continued to go deeper into debt, and with record debt levels matched by record
bankruptcy filings. The more a society polarizes, the more people on the
bottom borrow from those on the top.
When I started this book, the prestige of Anglo-American stock-marketcentered capitalism was a lot lower than it was when I finished it. I say a
few kind things about Japanese and Germanic systems of corporate finance,
ownership, and governance that would have been taken as semirespectable in 1992. In 1998, it is deeply against the grain (though not as
against the grain as saying kind things about Marx). But I’ll stick to my
position. The stagnation of Europe has a lot less to do with rigid structures
and pampered citizens than it does with fiscal and monetary austerity
dictated by the Maastricht project of unification. To blame Japan’s problems
7

WALL STREET

on overregulation is to ignore that the 1980s bubble was the product of
deregulation and a speculative mania. Isn’t enthusiasm about the American
Way in 1998 a bit reminiscent of that about Japan ten years earlier?
Coming after Japan’s extended slump, the collapse of the Southeast
Asian economies in 1997 was a great booster shot for American
triumphalism. Quickly forgetting the extraordinary growth performance
that led up to it — which, together with Japan’s is without precedent in
the history of capitalism, sustained rates of growth two to three times what
Britain and the U.S. experienced during their rise to wealth — Alan
Greenspan, editorialists, and professors of economics have pronounced
this the final word on economic policy.
It’s not clear why the weakest U.S. expansion in decades should be
taken as vindication of the American Way. Growth between the recession’s
trough in 1991 and the last quarter of 1997 was the slowest of any postWorld War II business cycle. Despite the mighty stock market, investment
levels are only middling, and productivity growth, modest. From the hype,
you’d also think the U.S. was leaving its major rivals in the dust, but comparisons of per capita GDP growth rates don’t bear this out. At the end of
1997, the U.S. was tied with France at second in the growth league, behind Canada, and just tenths of a point ahead of the major European countries. Step back a bit, and the U.S. sags badly. For the 1989–95 period,
when the U.S. was stuck in a credit crunch and a sputtering recovery, it
was at the bottom of the G7 growth league, along with Canada and the
U.K. Between 1979 and 1988, there’s no contest, with the U.S. tying France
for the worst numbers in the G-7. Comparisons with the pre-crisis Asian
tigers are hardly worth making.
It may be as capitalisms mature, financial surpluses break the bounds
of regulated systems, and force an American-style loosening of the bonds.
So all these questions of comparative capitalisms may be academic; it may
be the destiny of Japan and Western Europe to become more like the U.S.
Certainly that’s one of the likely effects of European monetary union. But
if that’s the case, then the debate shouldn’t turn on what “works better” in
some sort of engineering sense.
And moving beyond this technocratic terrain, to say a U.S.-style system
“works better” doesn’t say what it’s better at. The November 22, 1997,
issue of the Financial Times had three stories above its fold: two on the
crises in Asia, and one headlined “Reform may push US poor into squalor.” According to the last, a survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors
reported that “huge numbers” of poor Americans could face utter ruin
8

INTRODUCTION

when welfare “reform” takes full effect in 1999. That prospect, surely a
social disaster of great magnitude, is not defined by official lexicographers
as either a disgrace or a crisis.
The planned immiseration of the American poor has a lot to do with
the subject of this book. U.S. financial and ownership relations, which are
fragmented, abstract, and manic, seem deeply connected to other social
mechanisms — partly as causes, partly as effects — that make this such a
voracious, atomized, polarized, turbulent, often violent culture, one that
insists each of us be in competition with every other. If this is success,
then the U.S. model is a great success. It may even be partly duplicable in
countries interested in a fresh lifestyle strategy.
After several hundred pages of diagnosis, readers have a right to expect a prescription for cure at the end. I’ve tried to fulfill that, but the final
chapter is short and mainly suggestive. I could get high-minded and say
that the reason for that is that a transformative agenda is worth a book in
itself, which is true enough. But another reason is that financial reforms
are no easy or isolated matter. Money is at the heart of what capitalism is
all about, and reforms in the monetary sphere alone won’t cut much ice. If
you find the hypertrophy of finance to be appallingly wasteful and destructive then you’re making a judgment on capitalism itself. That’s not
very chic these days, but if I thought that this cultural pathology would
persist forever, then I wouldn’t have written this book.

notes
1. In many ways, credit markets are more important, but they don’t enjoy the same attention from the broad public, nor do they inspire the same lusts that stocks do.
2. Despite the prominence of the stock market, daily trading volume in U.S. Treasury
securities is over four times that of the NYSE — about $225 billion in federal paper in
early 1998, compared with $50 billion in stocks.

Instruments

In February 1998, $1.4 trillion a day cr ossed the wire connecting the world’s
major banks. That figur e — which captur es most of the world’s financial
action with the U.S. dollar on at least one side of the trade — was a mer e
$600 billion ar ound the time of the 1987 stock market crash. After that
inconsequential cataclysm, daily volume r esumed its mighty rise, passing
$800 billion in 1989, and $1 trillion in 1993 (Grant 1995, 1996). It is a pr
odigious number: an amount equal to a year’s U.S. gr oss domestic product
(GDP) tur ns over in a week, and total world pr oduct in about a month.
Where does it all come from, and wher e does it go? Open the Wall
Street Journal or the business section of a major metr opolitan daily, and
you get a clue. Every day, they publish an overwhelming array of price
quotes — thousands upon thousands — for stocks, bonds, currencies,
commodities, options, futures, options on futures, indexes, options on
indexes, mutual funds…. If you own a hundr ed shares of Iomega, or you’re
short wheat for April delivery, then you have no problem deciding what
they all mean — your money is at stake. But do all these prices, with acr es
of type and graphics devoted to analyzing and charting their often fevered movements in loving detail, have any meaning beyond the narr owly
mercenary? Is the movement of the Dow, reported in about 30 seconds on
every evening network newscast, of interest to anyone besides the half of
the population that owns stocks, or the 1% of the population that owns
them in meaningful quantity? And do these price gyrations have any r elation to the other news reported in the paper or on TV — to the fate of
corporations, to the real standar d of living, to our public lives?
Figuring that out has to start with a pictur e of the elements of this financial universe — the instruments and institutions that construct the claims
that people make on each other over time and space. These claims are
denominated in money, the stuf f that economists study, but economists
10

INSTRUMENTS

forget that money is a for m of social power. One of the persistent delusions of conventional theory is that money is “neutral,” a lubricant with no
influence of its own, one that mer ely simplifies transactions in an economy
based on the exchange of goods.1 In a barter economy, the seller of wheat
would have to find a personal buyer; in a money economy, the wheatholder can sell for money, and let the system take care of the rest.
Money is a richer phenomenon than that explanation allows; it is one
of our fundamental principles of social or ganization. Ownership is r epresented through monetary claims, and the exchange of those claims in the
financial markets amounts to the social construction of ownership.
Over the last decade or so, these “markets” — usually conveniently
referred to as an anonymous exter nal for ce, as pervasive and inevitable as
gravity — have gr own enormously. It’s a cliché of the daily press that the
markets ar e now more powerful than gover nments, that the daily votes
cast by the bond and curr ency markets ar e more important than elections,
legislatur es, and public budgets. The cliché contains a partial truth: these
markets ar e tremendously powerful. But they ar e social institutions, instruments of power, that derive their power in part fr om the sense of powerless awe they inspire among non-initiates. Say “the markets won’t like”
a minimum wage incr ease or a public jobs program, and critical scrutiny
often evaporates, like wishes crushed by the unfriendly voice of God.
While modern financial markets seem sublimely complex, they’r e essentially composed of several basic instruments and institutional participants. Most of the instruments, despite their apparent novelty, are quite
old, their age measur ed better in centuries than decades.
What ar e these markets, and who populates them?
stocks
To many people, the stock market is Wall Str eet, and the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) is the stock market. A recent edition of Paul Samuelson’s
warhorse economics text even described the exchange as the “hub” of
capitalism, with no further explanation. Geography r einforces this perception; the NYSE stands at the intersection of Broad and W all, at the spiritual epicenter of Manhattan’s financial district. But in fact, stock market
trading volume is dwar fed by trading in bonds and for eign exchange, and
the NYSE itself accounts for a declining shar e of stock market volume.
These mere facts aside, there is some justification in giving the stock
market the prominence it enjoys in the popular mind. But one notion that
11

WALL STREET

must be quickly dismissed is the idea that the market raises lots of capital
for real investment.2 Corporations typically sell lar ge blocks of stock when
they go from private (a small cir cle of family or otherwise tight owners) or
state hands (in a privatization) to “public” hands. It goes without saying
that a very narr ow segment of the public is involved. Afterwards, public
fir ms rar ely issue significant amounts of stock, and new flotations ar e but
a blip in the chart of corporate cash flows. Since the early 1980s, thanks to
buyouts and buybacks, mor e stock was retired than newly floated, transactions that wer e mostly funded through heavy borrowing.
But just because the stock market plays a very minor r ole in raising
investment finance doesn’t mean it’s a sideshow. Shar es of stock represent ownership claims on an economy’s real productive assets, and claims
as well to a portion of the present and futur e profits generated by those
assets. Though managers of public corporations enjoy partial autonomy
— just how much is a matter of dispute — they ar e the hired agents of the
stockholders, and ultimately answerable to them. In moments of crisis,
stockholders can intervene directly in the running of their corporation; in
more normal times, pleasing investors, which means pushing up the stock
price, is a prime managerial concer n. Failur es to please are punished by a
chronically low stock price, a condition that can be an invitation to a takeover. In mainstr eam theory, this is how the market disciplines managers;
that it doesn’t work very well is one of the themes of this book.
Stock comes in many flavors. Most prevalent — 98% of the market value
of the NYSE, almost all the Nasdaq — is common stock. Common stockholders have the last claim on a corporation’s income and assets; though
fir ms will occasionally str etch to meet a dividend, dividends ar e normally
paid after inter est owed to creditors — making common stockholders “residual claimants” in legal jar gon. After debtholders but ahead of common
stockholders are holders of preferred stock, who must be paid all dividends due them before owners of the common stock can get a penny. In
a bankruptcy, common stockholders ar e often wiped out; creditors and
holders of the preferred get paid off first. Common’s allur e is that if a
corporation does well, creditors and pr eferred stockholders can be easily
satisfied, and the excess juice all goes to the stockholders.

evolution from a founding principle
Today’s stock markets have their roots, as do many institutions of modern
finance, in medieval Italy, though unlike the more sophisticated early Italian
financial institutions, their early stock markets wer e pretty rudimentary.
12

INSTRUMENTS

Modern versions took shape first in Amsterdam in the 17th century and
then in London in the 18th, with the gr owth of government debt and cor porate shares. Free-market ideology to the contrary, the role of government debt in the development of finance can’t be exaggerated; while
American practice tr eats stock and government bond markets as being as
distinct as chur ch and state, in Britain, wher e church and state ar en’t so
separate either, people still call public debt certificates government stock.
In the early 17th century, the Dutch and English East India Companies
issued shares to the public to fund their early imperial enterprises (another state link to the development of finance); in return, investors were
granted a shar e of the profits in the form of dividends. But since the investors didn’t want to wed themselves irrevocably to these companies without any possibility of divorce, the share certificates were made fr eely
transferable. As R.C. Michie (1992) puts it, “what was being established
were markets to claims to futur e income” — fictitious capital, in Marx’s
famous phrase: not r eal capital, but claims on capital. This enables a whole
class to own an economy’s productive assets, rather than being bound to
a specific property as they once were.
The transfor mation of a futur e stream of dividend or inter est payments
into an easily tradeable capital asset is the founding principle of all financial markets. While the futur e payment stream of a bond is usually fixed,
and barring default fairly certain, dividends and the pr ofits on which they
ar e based are lar gely unpredictable. In most cases, they can be expected
to grow over time with the rest of the economy, but not always. Figuring
out the likelihood and speed of that growth is what much of the stock
game is all about.
Amsterdam’s early market was quite loosely organized; br okers and
their clients simply congregated ar ound the pillars of the exchange building and did deals. Ther e was no formal or ganization designed to police
conduct and of fer some guarantee against default until 1787. The first for mally or ganized exchange was established in Paris in 1724. The r evolution, however, so disturbed trading — war isn’t always good for business
— that London stepped into the breach.
The opening of the London Stock Exchange in 1802 marked the r eal
beginning of r ecognizably modern stock exchanges, with regular trading
and a fixed, self-r egulating membership. New York’s stock exchange was
founded 10 years before London’s (by 24 brokers meeting under a buttonwood tree at what is now 68 Wall Str eet), but the New York market would
take a back seat to London until fairly late in the 19th century. Paris would
13

WALL STREET

return to prominence some decades later as the major exchange for trading continental Eur opean shares (not just French ones), but it would never
again match London as a financial center .
What government debts and state-licensed monopolies were to the financial markets of the 18th century, railr oad shar es and bonds were to the
19th — claims on wealth that pr oliferated wildly and pr ovided rich raw
material for trading. British railway shar es grew from £48 million in 1848
to £1.3 billion in 1913; over the same period, U.S. railway stocks gr ew
from $318 million to $19.8 billion. Also over the same period, the London
exchange saw a tr emendous incr ease in trading of for eign shar es — a
reminder that in spite of today’s talk about the globalization of finance,
finance has long been as transnational as politics and technology allowed.
Modern American stock markets came of age in the late 19th and early
20th centuries, simultaneously with the emer gence of modern corporations, with dispersed owners and professional managers. The stock market was central to the establishment of these new institutions in the first
place, as small fir ms were combined into giants, and it quickly became
essential to settling matters ar ound their subsequent ownership. Late 19th
century promoters also thought of the market as a way to ease the burden
on small pr oducers who were being displaced or enveloped by
corporatization: modest stock holdings were a compensation for the loss
of real capital ownership (Livingston 1986).
After World War I, ther e was an attempt to r estore the borderless order
of the decades before the conflict, but the attempt never really took. Though
the U.S. enjoyed a tremendous boom during the 1920s, Eur ope wasn’t so
lucky; Britain suf fered chronically high unemployment, and Ger many was
a wr eck. When the U.S. boom ended with the 1929 crash, and the world
entered depression, the loose financial markets of the 1920s wer e indicted
as prime suspects. Many European markets were shut or sharply restricted,
and the New Deal brought the U.S. market under tight r egulation. 3
Stock markets and financial gunslinging in general r emained under
heavy suspicion until well after end of World War II; policy and habit conspired to keep stock and other financial markets sleepy for decades. New
York Stock Exchange trading volume for all of 1950 totaled 525 million
shar es, equal to about two average days’ trading in 1993, and a vigor ous
day in 1996. By the end of the 1950s, however , the market was beginning
to shake off this torpor; volume took off in the 1960s, plateaued in the
1970s, and then exploded during the 1980s (New Y ork Stock Exchange
1994, pp. 100, 101).

As this is written, stock markets in general ar e enjoying a period of high
prices and high pr estige, and not only in the First W orld.4 Encouraged by
official institutions like the W orld Bank and Inter national Monetary Fund
(IMF), Thir d World stock markets have flourished as tar gets for First World
investors, bored with the prospects of their own mature home markets.
Despite their growth in the last decade, they remain quite small, however,
and it doesn’t take much Norther n money to drive up prices ten- or a
hundr ed-fold — nor does it take much to generate a panic exit and a
stunning collapse in prices.

taxonomy
While just about every country in the world now has a stock market, their
size and importance vary gr eatly. One easy way of making this point is by
grouping national financial systems into bank-center ed and stock-mar ket-centered ones. In the former, stock markets tend to be small in size
and importance; not only do banks, rather than the stock and bond mar kets, provide most corporate finance, they own a great deal of corporate
stock as well. Germany is the classic example of a bank-center ed system,
with a market capitalization (measur ed relative to GDP) a quarter the level
of the U.S. and a fifth that of the U.K. Most of the continental Eur opean
countries tend towar ds Germanic levels of market capitalization, while
other English-speaking countries tend toward Anglo-American ones.
With the wave of free-market “reforms” of the last 15 years has come a
tremendous growth in stock markets in what is alter nately called the “developing” or Third World; in financial jar gon, their stock markets are usually called the “emerging” markets (though at moments like the 1994–95
Mexican crisis, wits call them submer ging markets). On balance, the
“emerging” markets r emain quite small, even after all this gr owth; in 1996,
the markets followed by the International Finance Corporation, the W orld
Bank’s in-house investment bank, accounted for just 11% of world stock
market capitalization, half their 21% shar e of global GDP. Still, within that
group, there ar e considerable variations, with Chile and South Africa showing market caps that would put them in the Anglo-American league, and
China bar ely on the radar scr een, at least in 1996. Y et despite the relative
size of some of these markets, they remain tiny on a world scale; an influx
of what would seem like pocket change to investors in New o
Yrk or London could easily buy up the entire Philippine or Argentine stock market.
The small size, when combined with the limited number of stocks traded,
make the emerging markets extraor dinarily volatile.

In the predominantly English-speaking countries, stock markets ar e also
essential mechanisms for r egulating how corporations ar e owned and run.
(This market style is sometimes called Anglo-Saxon, despite the presence
of many non-Anglo-Saxons in their populations. Anglo-American is a less
problematic label.) Nearly anyone with suf ficient cash or cr edit can enter
the open market and buy a contr olling inter est in a publicly traded corporation. 5 In Germanic countries, however, contr olling inter ests are typically
in the hands of lar ge banks, and it’s practically impossible for fir ms to be
bought and sold on the open market. With incr eased foreign investment
by German fir ms, and their listings on for eign stock exchanges, their model
appears to be taking on a mor e Anglo-Saxon cast.
Japan has slid in the rankings, fr om near-Anglo-American in its size, to
the lower third of the table. Controlling inter ests are typically held by banks
and close business partners like suppliers and customers, making it nearly
impossible for uninvited actors to buy up a Japanese fir m.

technical details
In the U.S., stocks and other securities are traded in two kinds of institutional envir onments: organized exchanges and over -the-counter (OTC).
In exchange trading, or ders to buy or sell are transmitted fr om customers
to a central trading floor which, despite computerization, is still populated
by specialized human traders who shout and gesticulate at each other to
consummate deals. With OTC trading, ther e is no central floor — just a
virtual exchange made up of networked computers.
The largest U.S. exchange is the New York Stock Exchange, which despite its relentless loss of market share to OTC trading, is still the home of
the shares of most large American corporations — over 2,300 fir ms in all
— as well as the U.S. trading for major for eign fir ms. To be listed on the
NYSE, firms must meet several criteria: a r ecord of consecutive profitability at least thr ee years long, tangible assets and a total market value of $18
million or mor e, a minimum of 1.1 million shar es outstanding, and at least
2,000 shar eholders (NYSE 1994, p. 31). While these standar ds may not
sound too rigorous, they rule out most U.S. corporations.
A customer buying a stock traded on the NYSE, whether an individual
trading 10 shar es or a money manager trading 100,000, transmits an or der
to his or her broker. The broker transmits the order to the firm’s trading
desk, which passes it on to the NYSE floor
. (To trade on the floor, the fir m
must be a member of the exchange.) The order can be filled in one of two
ways. Small, simple orders ar e filled through the NYSE’s SuperDot com17

WALL STREET

puter system; bigger orders ar e filled by human br okers cutting deals on
the exchange floor.
At the heart of the NYSE is its specialist system. Specialists are inhabitants
of the exchange floor who are assigned to make markets in specified stocks;
they’re annointed in this r ole by a board elected by exchange member.
Though their role isn’t especially obscure, their names usually ar e; unlike
brokers and portfolio managers, there ar e no celebrity specialists. They
have several tasks, for which they are handsomely rewarded. Specialists
maintain “the book,” once literally a paper r ecord but now a computerized r egistry, containing price and quantity infor mation on curr ent bids
(offers to buy) and asks (offers to sell) for the stocks assigned to them.
Customer orders may be placed either at the market or at a limit — that is,
either at pr evailing prices or at a specific price. Limit or ders can be placed
at prices far away fr om the prevailing price; investors may want to sell
shar es they own if they hit a certain price, either to limit losses or lock in
profits. When the market price hits the limit, the customer’s order is executed by the specialist.
In unusual cases wher e specialists are unable to find a willing buyer for
an eager seller, or vice versa, usually because of a fer ocious buying or
selling stampede, they are supposed to step in and satisfy the order, using
stock from their own inventory or money from their own pockets. Some
discretion is allowed here; specialists aren’t supposed to bankrupt themselves to maintain “a fair and orderly market,” as their brief is usually
phrased. But they do seem to smooth out the gyrations in moderately
extreme markets.
Specialists make a good deal of money in this role. Their books offer
them insights into patter ns of supply and demand that ar e offered to no
other market players, and they know when it’s better to meet orders from
their own resources or by matching public customers’ orders. Market students often scrutinize published data on specialists’ positions for insights
into what the supposedly smart money is doing.6
In over-the-counter trading, ther e is no central auction market. Customers still transmit or ders to brokers, but instead of going to the corner
of Broad and W all, the order is presented by phone or computer network
to other brokers, called market makers, who specialize in trading certain
stocks. A market maker, accor ding to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
is “any dealer who holds himself out…as being willing to buy and sell
security for his own account on a r egular or continuous basis.” T o do that,
a market maker publishes, either on paper or on computer screens, bid
18

INSTRUMENTS

and of fer price quotations, and, in the wor ds of the Securities and Exchange Commission r egulation, “is r eady, willing, and able to ef fect transactions in r easonable quantities at his quote prices with other brokers and
dealers” (quoted in Watson 1992).
At the organizational peak is the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and its automated quotation system (Nasdaq), which pr ovides
live computer quotes of stock trades to brokers around the world. The
National Market System (NMS), a subset of Nasdaq universe, is the trading
home of the biggest OTC stocks, like Microsoft and Intel. Many of the
NMS companies could trade on the NYSE, but for various reasons they
choose not to have their stocks listed there. But despite the sprinkling of
giants, listing r equirements for the NMS are significantly looser than the
NYSE’s: if a fir m is profitable, it needs tangible assets of at least $4 million
and a market value of at least $3 million; if the fir m is unpr ofitable, it
needs to hit values of $12 million and $15 million r espectively. In most
cases, it needs only 400 public shar eholders.
Traveling down the foodchain, you pass the Nasdaq stocks that ar en’t
part of the national system; these tend to be relatively obscure companies
whose stocks are somewhat thinly traded; a listing on the Nasdaq SmallCap
(small capitalization) market r equires only $4 million in assets, a market
value of $1 million, and 300 public shar eholders. But these look like blue
chips compared to stocks outside the Nasdaq system — like those that
trade on the so-called pink sheets, a price list distributed daily to br okers
on pink paper containing price quotes for stocks that trade essentially by
appointment only, with as few as one market-maker. By contrast, the big
NMS stocks can have as many as 30 or mor e market-makers, with the
average Nasdaq stock having ar ound 10.
In 1994, the Nasdaq came under heavy criticism in the academic and
popular press for unfair trading practices, notably wide spr eads between
bid and ask prices (Christie and Schultz 1994). That is, in comparison to
NYSE trading, buyers of stock paid high prices, and sellers received low
prices, with the dealers pocketing the difference. In particular , suspiciously
few Nasdaq quotes were for odd-eighths of a point and too many for even
quarters — like 10 1/4 instead of 10 1/8 or 10 3/8 — a r ounding that, of
course, favored the dealer. The academics concluded, modestly, that this
raised “the question of whether Nasdaq dealers implicitly collude to
maintain wide spr eads.” These spreads mysteriously narr owed the moment
preliminary findings wer e published in the press (Christie et al. 1994).
The American Stock Exchange dr ew marketing blood by pointing out
19

WALL STREET

that no major br oker — the Nasdaq’s market-makers — lists its stock on
the Nasdaq. If it’s so wonderful for investors and listed companies alike,
why do those who know its workings best not share in its wonders? But
academic studies and popular r eporting (Steiner and Salwen 1992) have
also shown that specialists often don’t publicize attractive bids and of fers,
preferring to reserve the sweetest deals for themselves.
In August 1996, the Securities and Exchange Commission decided that
Nasdaq dealers had, in the wor ds of the Los Angeles Times, “colluded to
boost profits by harming customers” (Paltr ow 1996). The National Association of Securities Dealers agr eed (without admitting to wr ongdoing) to
revamp its trading systems to prevent such abuses in the futur e. In r eleasing its decision, the SEC also r eleased tapes of conversations among dealers, including exchanges such as this:
Trader 1: “I bought 10 at 1/8, and don’t print it [report it] for, for a few minutes, ’cause I told the guy I’m just making a sale out of the blue.”
Trader 2: “I’ll, I’ll print after the bell.”
Trader 1: “Thanks, bud.”

•
Trader 3: “What can I do for you?”
Trader 4: “Can you go 1/4 bid for me?”
Trader 3: “Yeah, sure.”
Trader 4: “I sold you two (200 shares) at 1/4. Just go up there, OK?”
Trader 3: “I’m goosing it, cuz.”
Trader 2: “Thank you.”

Whatever the relative virtues of the systems, there’s no question that
the NYSE is losing share to the Nasdaq. In 1980, the Nasdaq traded 54% as
many shar es on the average day as the NYSE; in 1994, Nasdaq shar e volume was over 101% of the NYSE’s. Since NYSE stocks are, on average,
more expensive than the Nasdaq’s, share volume overstates things a bit,
but the trend is visible there, too; in 1980, the money value of shar es traded
on the Nasdaq was 17% of the NYSE’s; in 1994, it was 56% ($1.4 trillion vs.
$2.5 trillion). Still, the NYSE is hardly dying; the dollar volume of its trading gr ew more than sixfold between 1980 and 1994 — though the Nasdaq’s
grew more than twentyfold (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1994, pp. 528–9).
Of decreasing significance in the stock world is the NYSE’s neighbor
several blocks to the west, the American Stock Exchange (Amex). Once
the home of small growth companies, the Amex is now a mere flyspeck.
Few stocks of any significance ar e traded there, and trading volume was a
20

INSTRUMENTS

mere $36 billion in 1990. Amex volume fell fr om 10% of the Nasdaq’s in
1984 to 6% in 1994 (NASD 1995).
In an ef fort to boost its shabby image, the Amex has been tightening
listing standar ds, after scandal struck its Emer ging Company Marketplace
(ECM) shortly after its Mar ch 1992 opening. The ECM was touted by then
Amex-president James Jones — a former Oklahoma congr essman who
left the Amex to become U.S. ambassador to Mexico, where he served
during the Mexican crisis of 1994 and 1995 — as home to the “kind of
companies that will gr ow and make this country gr eat.” Unfortunately for
Jones and the Amex, the companies did little but embarrass the exchange.
Of the 22 companies, over half went public through the shell company
route — that is, a fir m with no actual business operations sells stock as a
“blind pool” to investors (i.e., a pig in a poke) and then acquir es a small
operating company with the proceeds of the stock sale. That method allows the initial owners of the shell to evade the scrutiny of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its nor mal r egistration and disclosur e requir ements. But that was only the beginning of the ECM’s malodor ous
life. Several weeks later, it emerged that one of the ECM 22, a maker of
flame r etar dants, was contr olled by an admitted inside trader and stock
manipulator who was also a convicted arsonist. And another ECM company was run by someone who’d previously been sued by the SEC for
various misdeeds; the legal trail was covered by the fact that her bad r ecord
was run up when her name was John Huminik, befor e the intervention of
hormones, scalpel, and a legal writ had tur ned her into Eleanor Schuler
(U.S. General Accounting Office 1994b; Norris 1995).
Stock performance is usually summarized by indexes. Most exchanges
ar ound the world publish their own indexes, which are not dir ectly comparable with each other. To addr ess the comparability problem, the
Financial Times and Morgan Stanley Capital Inter national of fer standar dized inter national indexes, covering countries and r egions; and the International Finance Corporation, the W orld Bank’s in-house investment bank,
publishes indexes for the “emerging” markets.
In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an average of 30 bluechip industrial stocks, is the most famous of averages, but it is far fr om
representative of the whole market. A broader blue-chip index is the Standard & Poor’s 500, an index of 500 industrial, service, and financial stocks;
it’s the most widely used measure for grading the performance of money
managers. S&P publishes scores of sectoral indexes, and they and other
fir ms produce indexes to measure big stocks, small stocks, medium stocks,
21

WALL STREET

and even moral stocks (those that ar e appropriate for “socially r esponsible” investment).
bonds and other credits
Despite the greater public visibility of stock markets, the financial heart of
capitalism is in the cr edit markets, a ter m covering loans arranged thr ough
a variety of instruments and institutions, fr om simple bank loans to complex bond products. As Marx (1981, p. 596) put it, “inter est-bearing capital
[is] the mother of every insane form”; debts, mere promises to pay, are
nonetheless transformed into commodities in the eyes of creditors. This
capitalization of pr omised incomes enables nearly everything, from an
industrial plant to an unspoiled wilder ness to a human life, to be modeled
as a quasi-cr edit, whose value today is the value of its future earnings
stream — profits or wilderness services or wages, adjusted for value over
time using pr evailing inter est rates and maybe an estimate of risk.
Marx enter ed that passage from a meditation on the strangeness of government debt, a place “where a negative quantity appears as capital” —
no asset behind it other than a gover nment’s promise to pay. But state
debt is far fr om uniquely insubstantial. Unlike stock, most bonds — loans
that can easily be traded on the markets — give you no claim of owner ship on a fir m’s capital assets. Though sometimes a pledge of collateral is
involved (as in so-called mortgage bonds), most ar e secured by the
borrower’s promise and the lender’s faith in that pr omise. The bond’s value
at any moment is the futur e stream of inter est payments that the borrower
promises to pay, with the return of principal at the bond’s maturity.
Sexy variations ar e plentiful — floating rate bonds, whose interest is
adjusted periodically; inflation-linked bonds, which guarantee a fixed rate
above the inflation rate; zer o-coupons, which are sold at a big discount to
face value, pay no inter est during their life, and ar e closed out with the
payment of the full face value at maturity. Whatever the kink, while cor porations can cut or skip dividend payments to shar eholders, suffering
only a blow to the stock price, missing a bond interest payment is likely to
result in bankruptcy, or fevered negotiations to avoid bankruptcy.
A lar ge, liquid market in gover nment debt with a central bank at its
core is the base of modern financial systems. Central banks manage their
domestic money supply through the purchase and sale of official paper,
and historically gover nment borr owers have usually been at the vanguar d
of the development of a national financial system. In a panic, money floods
22

INSTRUMENTS

out of stocks and private bonds and into government securities, especially short-ter m ones. Practically speaking, inter est rates on public debts
act as a benchmark for the r est of the credit system; interest rates for borrowers other than a central gover nment — state and local gover nments,
households, corporations — are usually set in r eference to government
rates at the same maturity. Markets in general seem to need benchmarks
like this; during the early 1990s, when trading in Latin American bonds
was highly fashionable, Mexico served as the benchmark, with inter est
rates quoted as so much over Mexico, the market’s blue chip.
Public paper is a nice mechanism for pr ofit making and income r edistribution. It pr ovides rich underwriting and trading pr ofits for investment
bankers and inter est income for individual and institutional r entiers, courtesy of nonrich taxpayers. Wall Str eet, despite its ideological fealty to balanced budgets, has made a fortune distributing and trading the
Reagan–Bush–early Clinton deficits. This experience has been r eproduced
on a smaller scale in many other parts of the world, as gover nment debt/
GDP ratios mor e or less doubled between 1980 and the early 1990s
(Goldstein et al. 1994, p. 35). If the U.S. budget deficit stays close to zer o
for years, Wall Str eet will have to make some very sharp adjustments,
though bonds could acquir e a scar city value.
Government debt not only promotes the development of a central national capital market, it pr omotes the development of a world capital market as well. Short-term paper like treasury bills — places that investors
can park short-ter m cash — is important for a curr ency’s admission to
world markets; the yen has remained a highly pr ovincial curr ency, accounting for only 6.7% of the trade among the six biggest economies and
8.6% of official for eign reserves transactions, in part because yen holders
lack a deep treasury bill market. 7 Central banks also deal in their own and
other governments’ paper in their often vain attempts to manage their
curr encies. Institutions like the World Bank led the way in inter nationalizing the cr edit markets, raising funds in one curr ency, transfor ming them
into another for temporary storage, and often lending in yet another .
Public debt is a powerful way of assuring that the state r emains safely
in capital’s hands. The higher a gover nment’s debts, the more it must please
its bankers. Should bankers gr ow displeased, they will refuse to roll over
old debts or to extend new financing on any but the most punishing ter ms
(if at all). The explosion of federal debt in the 1980s vastly incr eased the
power of creditors to demand auster e fiscal and monetary policies to
dampen the U.S. economy as it recovered, hesitantly at first but then with
23

WALL STREET

incr easing vigor, fr om the 1989–92 slowdown. Bill Clinton quickly lear ned
their power, when he had to abandon his tepid stimulus pr ogram in 1993
and tur n himself into an “Eisenhower Republican,” to satisfy what he called
“a bunch of fucking bond traders” (W oodward 1994).
That explosion of federal debt was prodigious. At the end of 1952, outstanding debt of the U.S. Treasury totaled 61% of GDP. That figur e fell
steadily for the next 20 years, bottoming out at 23% in 1974; it r ose a bit in
the late 1970s, to ar ound 25% in 1980, and then headed straight upwar ds
to 49% in 1994, then drifting town to 47% in 1997. Gr owth in agency debt
— mortgage agencies like Fannie Mae and Fr eddie Mac, the student loan
agency Sallie Mae, 8 and the Resolution Trust Corp., which funded the
savings and loan bailout — was even mor e dramatic. V irtually invisible at
under 1% of GDP in 1952, it r ose slowly to just under 5% in 1970; doubled
to nearly 10% by 1980; mor e than doubled again to 25% in 1990; and hit
35% with no sign of a pause by the end of 1997.
With the growth in Treasury debt came a torr ent of trading not only in
the bonds themselves, but also in associated “products,” as Wall Str eet
marketers call them, like futur es, options, repos, and swaps. This confir ms the accuracy of another of Marx’s (1977, p. 919) observations:
The public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation. As with the stroke of an enchanter’s wand, it endows unproductive money with the power of creation and thus turns it into capital,
without forcing it to expose itself to the troubles and risks inseparable from
its employment in industry or even in usury. The state’s creditors actually
give nothing away, for the sum lent is transformed into public bonds, easily
negotiable, which go on functioning in their hands just as so much hard
cash would. But furthermore, and quite apart from the class of idle rentiers
thus created, the improvised wealth of the financiers who play the role of
middlemen between the government and the nation, and the tax-farmers,
merchants and private manufacturers, for whom a good part of every national loan performs the service of a capital fallen from heaven, apart from
all these people, the national debt has given rise to joint-stock companies,
to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds, and to speculation: in a word,
it has given rise to stock-exchange gambling and the modern bankocracy.

trading T reasuries
The market in U.S. government bonds is the biggest financial market in
the world. At the center of the market are 38 major investment and commercial banks who ar e certified as primary dealers by the Federal Reserve
24

INSTRUMENTS

Bank of New York — the choice inner cir cle with which the Fed conducts
its official monetary business. At the end of 1992, accor ding to a New York
Fed survey, total daily trading volume averaged $400–550 billion, or over
$100 trillion a year . Traders tur ned over an amount equal to a year’s GDP
in about thr ee weeks. Of the total, $40–50 billion (9%) was among primary dealers; $50–60 (11%) was among primary dealers and their customers; $45–115 billion (20%) was among nonprimary dealers; and $250–300
billion (55%) consisted of “financing transactions,” deals that use U.S. T reasury paper as collateral. 9 It’s lar gely a family r omance among financiers.
A bit surprisingly, in this era of globalized finance, only about 4% of
that trading was done in London and another 1% in T okyo — meaning
that 95% of the market was in the U.S., mainly New Y ork. But the London
and T okyo action is enough to assure that there’s a r ound-the-clock market from 8 o’clock in the Tokyo Monday morning to 5 PM on the New
York Friday. Though some firms organize trading locally, the global houses
run a single portfolio in all thr ee centers. For traders in global fir ms, the
trading day begins in T okyo; they “pass the book” at about 4 or 5 in the
after noon Tokyo time to London, where it is 7 or 8 in the mor ning, and
pass it westwards at 1 PM to New York, where it is 8 in the mor ning. The
trading day ends when New York closes.
Treasury debt falls into thr ee categories — bills, with maturities running fr om three months to one year; notes, one year to 10; and bonds,
over 10. Most trading occurs in the two- to seven-year range. Shown on p.
26 ar e three “yield curves,” plots of interest rates at various maturities.
Normally the yield curve slopes gently upward, with inter est rates rising
as maturities lengthen. The r eason for this is pretty simple — the longer a
maturity, the mor e possibility there is for something to go wrong (inflation, financial panic, war), so investors r equire a sweeter return to tempt
them into parting with their money. It’s rar e, however, that a bondholder
would actually hold it to maturity; holding periods of weeks and hours ar e
more common than years. The Bank for Inter national Settlements (Benzie
1992, p. 43) estimated that the average holding period for U.S. T reasury
bonds and notes was just one month, with a similar figur e prevailing in
Japan, Ger many, and Britain. The average holding period for a T reasury
bill was thr ee weeks, ten weeks short of the shortest-lived-bill.

Except in times of crisis or hyperinflation, short-ter m inter est rates ar e
generally under the contr ol of the central bank. In the U.S., the benchmark short-ter m inter est rate is federal funds, which is what banks char ge
each other for overnight loans of r eserves.10 If the Fed wants to repress the
25

WALL STREET

economy by forcing inter est rates higher and r estricting the available supply of credit, it will drain r eserves from the banking system by selling part
of its inventory of Treasury securities. Unlike a private sale of securities,
which would keep the money sloshing within the financial system, a sale
to the Fed means that the dollars leave it. This forces the price of reserves
— fed funds — upwar ds. To stimulate, the Fed buys securities using money

from imploding. It’s likely that investors assumed that both extremes were
not sustainable, and that short rates would r eturn to more “normal” levels,
which is why the longer end of the curve never got so carried away.

munis
Federal government bonds ar en’t the only kind, of course. Cities and states
sell tax-exempt municipal bonds, which help retired dentists to shelter
income and local gover nments to build sewers and subsidize shopping
malls in the name of “industrial development.” The muni bond market is
smaller than the U.S. T reasury market — at the end of 1997, state and local
governments had $1.1 trillion in debt outstanding, compar ed to $3.8 trillion for the Treasury and another $2.7 trillion for gover nment-r elated financial institutions — and trading is usually sleepy and uninter esting. But
it can be lucrative for practitioners. Underwriting fir ms — the big investment and commer cial banks — contribute mightily to the campaigns of
local tr easur ers and comptrollers. Since so many give, it’s har d to see how
the local officials can decide among smooth W all Str eeters bearing gifts.
Despite some attempts to rein in this essentially legal for m of graft, it’s
almost certain to continue (T aylor 1995). The nexus of bond dealers who
raise money for local governments, r eal estate developers and construc26

tion contractors who profit from the capital expenditur es so financed, the
lawyers who service all sides, and the politicians supported by the rest of
the gang ar e common structur es of urban and r egional power in the U.S.
They assure that the budget will be full of subsidies and tax br eaks to
developers and contractors, that fr esh land will be developed often at the
expense of existing settlements, and that in a crunch welfar e and other
public services will be cut but debt service will continue to flow.
It was long held by the courts that inter est on municipal debt could not
be taxed for Constitutional r easons, but a 1988 Supr eme Court decision
changed that. The indulgence has been excused on the grounds that it
lowers the borrowing costs for cities and states; from a bondholder’s point
of view, a 6% tax-fr ee interest rate is as good as an 8–9% taxable one,
assuming an income tax rate of ar ound 30%. 11 But a closer look reveals a
nice subsidy to the rich at the expense of the U.S. Treasury. The exemption of municipal bond inter est costs the federal government just over $20
billion a year (U.S. Of fice of Management and Budget 1995, p. 42). For mer
New York State Comptroller Edward Regan (1996) estimated that about
two-thirds of the subsidy goes to state and local governments, and onethir d to wealthy bondholders. Regan concluded, “If you’re not in high
[tax] brackets and don’t own these bonds, you lose every time your state
or local government borr ows,” since the municipal subsidy means higher
federal taxes (or r educed federal services) for the non-bondholder.

corporations and the erosion of commitment
Corporate bonds are the last major type. The market is lar ge — at $3.3
trillion in 1997, starting to appr oach the U.S. Treasury market in size —
but doesn’t trade anywher e near as fr enetically, and hasn’t made much
news since the junk bond boom and bust of the 1980s. Annual tur nover
amounts to only a few days’ worth of Treasury action.
While nonfinancial corporate bond debt has gr own impressively — from
an amount equal to 13% of GDP in 1980 to 18% in 1997 — financial fir
ms
were busier issuers, rising fr om 3% of GDP to 17% over the same period.
Much of this was accounted for by the growth in asset-backed securities
(ABS) — cr edit car d r eceivables and mortgages packaged into bonds and
sold on the markets rather than r emaining with the banks originating the
loans). Nonexistent in 1983, ABS issuers’ bonds outstanding wer e worth
9% of GDP in 1997. Such securitization has shifted risk fr om banks to the
institutional investors who buy asset-backed bonds, and has cr eated vast
new pots of money to fund the consumer credit boom.
27

WALL STREET

In most cases, only the best corporations are granted access to bond
markets — ones whose condition is fairly widely known, and easily analyzed. This is especially true of the short-term corporate debt called commercial paper (CP) — the unsecur ed debt of large firms, which is secured
only on their promise and r eputation. The development of the CP market
has been a blow to banks, which used to have a lock on these blue-chip
customers. CP and securitization have r eplaced “relationship” banking —
long-term associations between firms and their bankers — with “transactions” banking, in which all that matters is the beauty of the deal.
Small, obscur e firms ar e rar ely granted access to the bond market. A
memorable exception was the junk moment of the 1980s, when the most
improbable adventures were financed, and inter est was often paid not in
real cash, but in a fistful of new bonds. The market collapsed in 1989,
languished for years before enjoying a vigorous recovery into the late 1990s,
though nothing like its heyday a decade earlier . There’s evidence that the
collapse of the junk market was good for banks, who picked up some
junk-class borr owers, who pay high interest rates — high enough, presumably, to absorb the occasional default.
derivatives
This once-obscure word became famous in 1994, when after five years of
indulgent policies, the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates, causing derivatives to blow up all over. Putatively sophisticated giant corporations, who thought they were limiting risk thr ough exotic instruments
crafted by Wall Str eet, found themselves losing millions instead. Orange
County, Califor nia, lost millions on derivatives, and filed for bankruptcy
rather than tax its rich citizens enough to make good on their debts, 12 and
a small ar my of Wall Str eet hotdogs were either badly wounded or driven
(at least temporarily) out of business. To avoid embarrassment and possible runs, several prominent mutual fund companies had to subsidize
derivatives losses in bond and money-market funds.
People heard and said bad things about derivatives without too clear a
sense of what they are. The word r efers to a broad class of securities —
though securities seems too tangible a word for some of them — whose
prices are derived from the prices of other securities or even things. They
range fr om established and standar dized instruments like futur es and options, which ar e very visibly traded on exchanges, to custom-made things
like swaps, collars, and swaptions.
28

INSTRUMENTS

As with most basic financial instruments, derivatives ar e quite old. A
1688 tr eatise on the workings of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange described
techniques very much like modern futur es and options. Organized futur es trading of agricultural commodities ar ose in Chicago the mid-19th
century; the modern futur es contracts in cor n and wheat began trading in
1859. Options on futur es traded in Chicago in the 1920s, until the New
Dealers snuffed them as part of the general war on speculation, identified
as a prime suspect in causing the Gr eat Depression (Merton 1992; Newberry
1992; U.S. Commodity Futur es Trading Commission 1995).

mechanics of futures and options
Futur es markets exist in a range of r eal and financial commodities; options ar e traded on individual stocks, stock indexes, and futur es contracts.13
A futur es contract is an agr eement made by its buyer to take delivery of a
specific commodity on a specific date, and by its seller to make delivery.
Options contracts give buyers the right to buy or sell a particular asset
either on a particular date (Eur opean option) or at any time fr om when
the option contract is opened until its expiration date (American option).
Options to buy are called calls, and options to sell, puts. An essential difference is that someone who holds a futures contract on its expiration
date must take delivery of the underlying commodity, while the holder of
an option need not. In practice, however, almost all futur es contracts ar e
closed out before their maturity date; less than 1% of annual trading ends
up being consummated in possession-taking.
Some examples might put flesh on these definitions. A single futures
contract in wheat covers 5,000 bushels. People who buy July wheat contracts in April agr ee that should they still hold the contracts come July,
they will take possession of the wheat at the contract’s stated price. (If
wheat actually changes hands, it’s typically in the for m of war ehouse receipts, not railcars full of grain.) Should the price have risen, then that will
look like a good deal; if it’s fallen, it will look bad.
April sellers of July wheat, however, agree to the reverse — that they will
deliver the wheat come July. As with most financial markets, sellers need not
actually own the commodity they sell. Farmers may indeed sell their crops
forward in the futures markets. But your average speculator has no wheat
to sell; he or she is simply hoping the price will drop. A sale made by
someone who doesn’t own the underlying asset — and this applies to
bonds and stocks as well as wheat — is selling it “short,” on the anticipation of buying it back at a lower price, or , in a pinch, buying it in the open
29

WALL STREET

market at whatever price prevails and delivering the goods.14 Short-selling
exposes the practitioner to enormous risks: when you buy something —
go long, in the jar gon — your loss is limited to what you paid for it; when
you go short, however, your losses are potentially without limit. In theory,
brokers are supposed to be sure their clients have the credit rating to justify short-selling, though things don’t always work out by the book.
Options are similar. On April 18, 1995, the July wheat contract closed at
$3.5175 per bushel for a contract covering 5,000 bushels, or $17,587.50
per contract. The typical player would have to put up 5% mar gin — a
good faith cash deposit with the broker, who treats the other 95% as a
loan, on which inter est is charged — or $880. An option to buy that July
contract at $3.50 a bushel, called a 350, closed the same day at 12.5¢ per
bushel, or $625 for the full 5,000 bushels. The option to buy it at $3.60 —
a 360 — closed at 8.75¢, or $437.50 for the whole contract. Should wheat
climb in price, the option prices would increase also — generally point
for point with the 350 option (since it’s so close to the target, or “strike”
price), and less than point for point with the 360 (since it’s away fr om the
tar get, or “out of the money”). Rights to sell the wheat at 350 — puts —
closed at 10.75¢/bushel; the 360 puts closed at 16.5¢. Since the 360 puts
give their owner the right to sell at a price above the current market, they’r e
called “in the money.” In general, calls ar e mirr or images of puts; calls rise
in price as their underlying asset rises; puts fall in price. The principles ar e
the same for a stock option. A single “IBM July 90 call” gives the buyer the
right to buy 100 shar es (a “r ound lot”) of IBM at $90 a shar e; an “IBM July
90 put” gives its buyer the right to sell IBM at 90.
The price of an option is generally a r eflection of market interest rates,
the time to maturity, the closeness of the price of the underlying asset to
its strike price, and that underlying asset’s historical price volatility. Higher
inter est rates, a longer time to maturity, and gr eater volatility tend to raise
prices. In the 1970s, Fischer Black and Myr on Scholes developed an options pricing for mula that has become a classic; it’s been tinker ed with
over the years, but their fundamental technique r emains canonical.

from 1,300% returns to the sidewalk
Put- and call-buying is fairly simple. Things do get mor e complicated, much
more complicated. An owner of 100 shar es of IBM can sell a call against
those shares; should the price rise, he or she would have to buy back the
call at a loss — the loss being partly offset by the (paper) rise in the value
of the underlying shar es — or run the risk of having the stock “called
30

INSTRUMENTS

away” by the fortunate buyer of the call. People with losing positions usually close them out at a loss before their maturity date; actual or ders to
deliver, or exercises, are fairly rar e.
Plungers can also sell calls without owning the underlying asset; this is
called “going naked.” The naked call seller runs a risk far gr eater than
mere embarrassment; as with any short sale, the losses ar e theoretically
limitless. Someone who shorts a stock at 90, or sells a 90 call when the
underlying stock is trading at 90, runs the risk that a sharp runup in the
stock, whether because of a mania or a takeover, could force the price to
150 or higher .
And things get more complicated still. Complex combinations of futur es and options positions are common. In options: short both calls and
puts, on the hope that the underlying asset will go nowhere; long both
calls and puts, on the hope that it will take off dramatically in one dir ection or another , it matters not which; long and short calls in strange combinations of maturity and prices; long an asset and short calls for twice the
quantity of the underlying asset (a way of going short but hedging one’s
bets); long an asset and short half the quantity of calls (a way of going
long but hedging one’s bets). In futures: long crude oil and short gasoline,
on the hope that the spread between raw and r efined products will nar row; short crude and long gasoline, on the r everse hope (so-called crack
spreads); long soybeans and short soy oil; long Treasury bills and short
Treasury bonds, or long Eur odollar deposits and short Treasury bills —
both on the hope that interest rate spreads will change in one’s favor.
But it’s not just speculation alone that could motivate complex positions like this. Consider the manufactur er of cooking oil; it buys grains
and sells oil made fr om that grain — in financial ter ms, it goes long the
raw pr oduct and short the r efined. But the timing doesn’t always work in
unison; it could buy the grain today, only to find the price of oil collapsing
tomorrow. Using futures, it could lock today’s price spread for business it
will do several months down the road. That would insulate it fr om the
effects of any price changes, whether favorable or unfavorable.
All these strategies, simple purchases or sales or complex combinations of both, can be motivated either by gut instinct or complex mathematical models, by the desire to limit exposure or to bet the house, by
routine business decisions of interested parties or speculative interests of
players who couldn’t tell soybeans from seed corn. But whatever the motivation or strategy, it’s usually estimated that 80–90% of nonpr ofessional
futur es and options traders lose money.

WALL STREET

Norm Zadeh, a money manager and savant based in Beverly Hills who
used to run an option-trading competition, said that some of his winners
were literally “sleeping on grates” a year or two after their victories. Some
would rack up 1,300% r eturns, take out ads, attract clients, and then lose
all their money and then some.
Longer-lived winners ar e either commercial inter ests or professionals
like floor traders and br okers. Most nonprofessionals have no idea what
they’re doing and often lose their shirts. Pr os speak mockingly of people
who buy calls just because they think a stock is going to go up; the amateurs neglect to determine whether the call is under - or overpriced according to theoretical computer models, or neglect to limit their risks
through the use of complex hybrid structures.

standardize, centralize
As complex as this is, most of it is transpar ent to the participant. 15 Customers submit orders to their brokers, who transmit them to the exchange
floor. The floor is populated by employees of the big br
okerage houses
who are the medium for these orders, as well as by independent traders,
known as locals, who trade for their own accounts. While ther e must be a
buyer for every seller, the exchanges take car e of the details of matching
the two parties. This task is simplified by the fact that the contracts ar e so
highly standar dized. Standar dization and centralization wer e the key to
the development of modern futur es exchanges, which have changed little
(except for the replacement of paper by computers) since the turn of the
century when formal clearinghouses r eplaced informal “rings” of traders
(Williams 1986, p. 5). Clearinghouses of fer standar dized contracts and a
painless (to the traders) matching of buyers and sellers, in place of custom
deals that once were made among individual ring members.
The modern exchange and clearinghouse system didn’t emer ge fully
formed. Informal trading arrangements, not mer ely within rings that knew
each other, but among rings and individuals who had no gr eat familiarity
with each other, ballooned in complexity. The Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT) at first only offered a forum for individual traders, a central location for fir ms’ clerks. Before the CBOT clearinghouse was formed, clerks
would run about with war ehouse receipts, exchanging titles to goods on
behalf of their employers. In hectic moments, firms would pass receipts
along to other fir ms, sometimes a chain as long as 10 or 25 fir ms, without
any written r ecord; fir ms would often receive receipts for contracts they
never made. With the clearinghouse, a single clerk could examine all the
32

INSTRUMENTS

trading lists simultaneously, and arrange transfer of the traded goods.
Options evolved a bit more slowly. Calls and puts on stocks have been
traded for a long time, but the trading was fairly thin. Deals had to be
nearly custom-made; buyers and sellers had to be matched specifically,
which kept trading slow and markets illiquid. However, the Chicago Boar d
Options Exchange, a spinoff of the CBOT, began trading listed options —
standardized contracts settled at a clearinghouse — in the mid-1970s. After a slowish start, trading exploded: fr om no contracts (aside fr om a few
custom deals) in 1970, to 97 million in 1980, to 202 million in 1992. 16
Clearinghouses ar e at the heart of the process. Every day, firms submit
a list of their trades to the clearinghouse — buying wheat, selling bonds
— and the clearinghouse checks and r econciles the filings. Then the clearinghouse either pays or bills the member, depending on the net monetary
value of the day’s trades. The important featur e of the modern system is
that settlement is typically in cash; the economic point is that a futur es
contract is a way of tur ning a thing pr omptly into money — and money of
a for m that can be transfor med into scores of other assets. With futur es, a
bushel of wheat can almost instantly be traded for its equivalent in cash,
which then can be tur ned into oil, Treasury bonds, or a lobster dinner.
While outright market manipulation — cor ners and such — is rar e today, minor of fenses are common and certain kinds of insider action ar e
perfectly legal. When the major grain companies negotiated the sale of
wheat to the USSR in the 1970s, they didn’t announce the deal publicly for
a week or so. In the meanwhile, they loaded up on futures, a practice
euphemistically known as “anticipatory hedging.” Or when floor traders
get big orders from customers, orders big enough to move prices significantly in one dir ection or another, they will frequently wink at a buddy,
who then makes the appropriate trade just before the big order is placed.
The conspirators can split the profit later by arranging dummy trades.
But in the big pictur e, these are fairly minor events; the populist claim
that the futur es markets rig prices in a major way — hear d at one time
from heartland far mers, and now mainly fr om Third World commodity
exporters — has little basis in fact. The cr eation of futur es markets usually
under mines cartels, rather than r einforcing them. Major commodity price
trends ar e the result of the interplay of supply and demand ar ound the
cost of production, a dull explanation, but fundamentally true. Thir d World
commodity exporters face chronic problems of oversupply that aren’t
caused by the gnomes of Chicago.

bespoke derivatives
This section is for readers who want to get some idea of what really complex derivatives are about; those who don’t care ar e advised to skip a few
pages for a discussion of the point of all this inventiveness.
Players who find the off-the-rack derivatives that trade on exchanges
too common can always tur n to custom-tailor ed instruments. The lack of
standar dization makes them untradeable, but the possibilities ar e limited
only by imagination and the number of willing partners. As with exchangetraded derivatives, the custom kind — also called over-the-counter (OTC)
— can serve as a hedge or a bet, or even both at once.
Details of custom derivatives may be more than many r eaders want to
know, but they do involve the full richness of financial imagination. Swaps
were pioneered in the late 1970s, but the first deal to attract wide attention
was a curr ency swap between IBM and the World Bank in 1981, and the
first inter est rate swap was one involving the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), a U.S.-gover nment-sponsored vendor of student
loans (Abken 1991). 17 Unlike exchange-traded derivatives, swaps don’t
really involve a claim on an underlying asset; in most cases, the partners
in the swap, called counterparties, swap two sets of cash flows, cash flows
that ar e usually thr own off by positions in other securities (bond interest,
stock dividends, etc.).
That sounds terribly abstract; maybe a bit mor e detail about so-called
“plain vanilla” swaps will make it clear er. In a curr ency swap, the two
counterparties exchange specific amounts of two different curr encies,
which ar e repaid over time according to a fixed schedule which r eflects
the payment of interest and amortization of principal. Essentially, the
counterparties ar e lending each other curr encies and paying back the loan
over time. The interest rates char ged can be either both fixed, or both
floating, or one fixed and one floating.
In an inter est rate swap, the counterparties exchange payments based
on some underlying principal amount (called the “notional” amount). One
set of payments could be at floating rates (that is, adjusted with changes in
market rates) and the other fixed, or both could be at floating rates, but
tied to different market rates.
This still sounds very abstract. The evolution of the currency swap from
its 1970s ancestor , the parallel loan agr eement, may make things clear er.
Imagine that a U.S. fir m would like to borrow German marks, for use by a
German subsidiary, and a Ger man fir m would like to borrow dollars, for

34

INSTRUMENTS

complementary reasons. Both the German and the U.S. fir ms could issue
bonds in their domestic markets in similar amounts, swap the principal,
leaving the U.S. firm paying mark-denominated inter est and the German,
dollar inter est. In effect, each has borr owed in the other’s capital markets
— something they might otherwise have been unable to do because of
legal restrictions or the lack of name r ecognition. The problem with such
agr eements was that if one party defaulted, the other was still on the hook
for principal and inter est. Curr ency swaps take care of this by stipulating
that a default by one party means the end of the agr eement; this limits risk
only to the difference between the two interest streams, not the full face
value of principal and inter est.
And here’s an example of an inter est rate swap (Abken 1991). Say a
bank issues a one-month certificate of deposit, and then invests the proceeds in a two-year note whose interest payments are tied to the London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR, the rate banks char ge each other in the
London-based Euromarkets). The CD will matur e well before the note,
and the rate the bank might have to pay the CD holder may not move in
lockstep with LIBOR. Should the two interest rates mar ch to their own
drummers, the bank could find itself losing money on the two-sided transaction. T o protect itself, the bank could visit its swap dealer, and work out
a LIBOR–CD swap. The bank would pay the dealer the LIBOR interest
rate on the underlying principal, and the dealer would pay some CD-linked
index rate (minus a fee, of course). The swap dealer could either be acting
on its own account, hoping to make money on the fee and maybe some
clever trading, or it could be acting on behalf of a customer with complementary needs. The principal amount never changes hands, however , only
the interest payments do. That’s why the underlying principal is r eferred
to as the “notional” amount.
An old-fashioned banker might also ar gue that funding a two-year investment by a series of 24 monthly loans is a dumb thing to do, and the
swap is a fancy way of getting ar ound that; why not issue a two-year CD
to fund a two-year investment? But inter est rates on two-year CDs may not
be very favorable, and it may be that the bank will come out ahead with
the swap. If all goes well, of course.
These are only the simplest examples; intensely more complex deals
can be arranged. Swaps can be combined with options in order to limit
swings in floating rate payments. Say two parties enter an inter est rate
swap that begins with neither having to exchange money; both the fixed
and floating rate ar e the same, at 8%, say. But a month later , when it’s time
35

WALL STREET

to adjust the rates on the floating half of the deal, market rates have risen
to 10%. That means the payer of the floating rate would have to hand over
to the counterparty 2% of the underlying notional principal. Should rates
rise dramatically, the deal could get very expensive. Prudence might lead
the payer of the unpredictable rate to buy a “cap” — an option that limits
the maximum floating rate to a fixed level, say 9% in our example. The
seller of the cap, however, has to pay any amount above 9%.
Further complications ar e immediately possible: the cap seller will no
doubt want to hedge somehow, and the floating-rate payer might want to
offset the cost of buying the cap by selling a “floor,” the mirr or image of
the cap. By selling a floor, the floating-rate payer limits any gains fr om a
fall in market inter est rates. A cap and floor together create an inter est rate
“collar” — the establishment of upper and lower bounds on a floating
rate. The final word in the exotic vocabulary is “swaption,” an option to
enter into a swap, for those who are shy about making commitments.
After all this maneuvering, it looks suspiciously like a Rube Goldberg version of a fixed inter est rate, but participants ar e adamant that all the complexity is worth it — with the bankers who sell the instruments the most
adamant of all.
OTC derivatives began their stunning takeof f in the middle 1980s, par alleling the rise in trading of their exchange-traded cousins. But wher e
much of the rise in exchange-traded instruments was simply a matter of
Eur ope and Japan catching up with U.S. financial futur es markets, OTC
growth was mainly the proliferation of new instruments worldwide. In
1986, notional principal in inter est rate swaps was $400 billion, with another $100 billion in curr ency swaps outstanding; at the end of 1990, the
figur es were $2.3 trillion and $578 billion, r espectively, to which had been
added another $561 billion in caps, floors, collars, and swaptions; in 1997,
notional principal on inter est rate swaps totaled $22.1 trillion, and cur rency swaps, $1.5 trillion (Bank for Inter national Settlements 1998).
The biggest users of currency swaps once were nonfinancial corporations — the multinationals that dominate world trade, who borr ow and
do business in scores of currencies around the world. But financial institutions have been steadily incr easing their use, with 40% of notional principal outstanding, a bit ahead of nonfinancial fir ms, with governments a
distant thir d. Financial institutions dominate the market for inter est rate
swaps; after all, inter est-bearing paper is the basic commodity they deal
in. Corporations accounted for just 23% and gover nments, 6%. The U.S.
shar e of swap markets is surprisingly small — less than a thir d of inter est
36

INSTRUMENTS

rate swaps and quarter of the curr ency kind — and the dollar’s shar e has
been shrinking steadily, fr om 79% of inter est rate swaps in 1987 to 30% in
1996, with the yen and the Eur opean curr encies rising dramatically. No
doubt European and Asian economic integration is at work her e, though
the merger of Continental countries into the eur o will change everything.
Moves are alr eady underway to trade standar dized swaps on exchanges,
or develop clearinghouses for OTC swaps, but it’s not clear that this will
work; needs may be too personal, and counterparties may not want to
expose themselves to the scrutiny of taking public positions.

the point of it all
Having inspected the machinery, the question arises — what’s the point?
Isn’t this all just a fanciful overlay, somewher e between irrelevant and
malignant, on “r eal” activity? One answer might be that derivatives mar kets are simply the commodity form raised to a higher level of abstraction:
the commodity is a thing whose purpose in life is to be sold and transformed into money; once transfor med into money, financial markets develop so that money itself might be deployed pr
ofitably. A r elated answer
would be that the purveyors of derivatives have a great incentive to invent
new products: profits ar e always highest on newborn instruments, though
this advantage quickly deteriorates as competitors mimic the pr oduct.
But those explanations ar e too crude for sophisticates. In polite discourse, derivatives ar e often justified by resort to parables about far mers
and millers. The far mer sells wheat forward to lock in a harvest price while
it’s still in the gr ound, and the miller buys forwar d to guar d against unpleasant price spikes. In both cases, potential gains — a fall in price for
the miller, a rise for the far mer — ar e surrendered in advance to avoid
potential losses. This is the “insurance” theory of futures markets. There’s
also a liquidity theory — that the far mer sells today to boost cash flow,
since money today always feels better than the hope of money tomorrow.
This model is clean, and it even allows for speculators. Speculators,
who want to gamble on movement in prices — up or down, the bigger the
better — are good for a market, because they can stand on the other side
of a trade, ther eby bringing depth and liquidity to a market. Derivatives
markets serve the social function of shifting risk fr om the hedger to the
speculator, presumably incr easing the happiness of both.
The rural cast of characters gives the model a homey appeal, but r eal
life is different. First, agricultural futur es aren’t r epresentative of the actual
trading world. T rading in financial futur es (stocks, bonds, and currencies)
37

WALL STREET

accounts for almost 70% of the total; ener gy products, another 12%; and
metals, 4%; ag commodities ar e only 15%. The sole producer of Treasury
bonds is the U.S. government, but it has no pr esence in the futures markets in its paper; the major players ar e the big financial institutions who
trade it. They use futur es markets to speculate for their own profit, or to
hedge positions taken when buying or holding instruments for customers
or their own inventory. The far mer and the miller ar e strangers to the
wonderworld of Treasury debt.
But the homily har dly applies even where they aren’t strangers, in the
classic agricultural markets. A 1977 survey (cited in Shiller 1993, p. 101)
found only 6% of far mers bought or sold any futur es; even in the biggest
size class, no more than 13% did. But the trading far mers were mainly
speculating, not classically hedging: two in thr ee were trading in cr ops
other than those they were growing, and thr ee in four bought contracts
rather than selling them, as the homey myth tells it. (Far mers may be well
positioned to speculate in their own crops; they have “inside” info on
their markets that may be unknown to Chicago traders or to lawyers speculating fr om Dallas.) Roughly a fifth of wheat sales in the same 1977 survey
were done on a forwar d basis — though many of these forward sales
occurr ed after price spikes, meaning that far mers were locking in what
they thought were to be “high” prices. A true hedger wouldn’t change
strategy based on a market judgment.
To be fair, futur es markets are dominated by commercial inter ests, not
outsiders. Grain buyers buy heavily in the futur es markets, as do bond
dealers and oil r efiners. According to Steve Briese (personal communication), editor of the Minneapolis-based futur es newsletterThe Bullish
Review, commercial inter ests account for about 60–70% of the open
contracts in major commodity and financial futur es markets. Small
speculators account for 20–30%, and big speculators for ar ound 10%. 18
But commercial inter ests, be they farmers or bond dealers, can speculate
just like anyone else.
Even apparently cautious derivatives users — multinational corporations (MNCs) who have to cope with volatility in interest rate and for eign
exchange markets that inter fere with their real-world businesses — can
disguise adventur e as prudence. Nonfinancial fir ms ar e heavy users of
derivatives; two-thirds of lar ge U.S. corporations used derivatives regularly in 1993, according to a survey by the industry newsletter Swaps
Monitor (Hansell 1994), with For d r eporting a notional value of its positions as $45 billion; GE, $27 billion; GM, $25 billion; and IBM, $18 billion.
38

INSTRUMENTS

Nonfinancial corporations ar e often “selective” hedgers, which means
they don’t hedge when they think they hold a winning hand. Finance &
Treasury (1993) , a newsletter for corporate treasur ers, demanded of its
readers: “Time to confess: are you trading for pr ofit or ar en’t you? If the
answer is yes, then why not own up to it?” In a 1992 survey, F&T found
that under 10% of MNCs described their tr easuries as running for -profit
operations; the official line is that they existed to manage risk. Y et only
13% r equired 100% hedging r outinely; by not hedging, the firm was consciously taking on risk — risk that it could only justify as an attempt at
profit. The newsletter offers the example of a U.S. MNC, which borrowed
in Spanish pesetas to fund a Ger man subsidiary, even though peseta inter est rates were higher than D-mark rates — because it was betting on a
peseta devaluation. Fir ms ar e reluctant to admit to speculating with the
treasury because stockholders and regulators might be displeased.
Even were the hedging story a fuller explanation of derivatives markets
than it seems to be, is hedging necessarily a good thing? Barry Schachter’s
(1992) r eview of options theory makes it clear that mainstream finance
theorists do not speak with one voice on whether options make sense or
not — whether, in their absur dly mathematical world, options pr omote
equilibrium or perturb it, whether they’r e functional or “r edundant.” Ther e
ar e plenty of theories, none of them predominant or terribly convincing.
Schachter is r educed to saying that “The huge volume of trade in options
worldwide could be taken as supporting the conclusion that options make
a dif ference.” No doubt they do, but of what sort?19
It’s possible that hedging leaves society as a whole worse of
f than it
would be if unhedged. David Newberry (1992) offered this example. Compare two arrangements for gr owing rice, one safe, the other higher yielding and mor e profitable, but riskier (for example, a high-yield strain subject
to disease in certain climates). W ithout futur es markets, far mers would be
less likely to grow the risky rice than they would if they could sell a portion of the crop forward to speculators. In the second world, supplies
would be more volatile than in the first, and spot prices pr obably would
be too. In this case, hedging promotes instability.
But even if markets did neutralize price exposur e, prices are only part
of the story. “[I]f prices are stabilized,” wr ote Newberry, “but quantities
remain unstable, incomes may be less stable than if prices wer e free to
move in r esponse to the quantity changes.” Both Newberry’s and
Schachter’s inability to summon power ful ar guments in support of the
derivatives markets is striking, given their gr owth over the last 20 years.
39

WALL STREET

Journalists, however, have no problem in composing apologias. Well
along in the 1994 derivatives hysteria, true to its r ole as the organ of
reasssurance, the New York Times (Hansell 1994) pointed up the virtues of
derivatives, calling as lead witness W illiam McDonough, pr esident of the
New York Fed. McDonough warned against “derivatives angst,” which
threatened the smooth functioning of the market, which thr eatened everything good: “The existence of derivatives,” McDonough said, speaking
in the midst of the weakest U.S. economic expansion since World War II
with investment well below Golden Age levels, “increases the level of
investment and makes possible greater economic growth.”
As the Times put it, derivatives ar e lovely if they’re in the right hands,
danger ous otherwise. “You don’t put an average pilot in an F-15 fighter
without special training,” Harvar d finance pr ofessor Andre Perold told
correspondent Saul Hansell. Hansell picked up on Perold’s martial metaphor, noting that “once companies lear n how to use this advanced financial weaponry for defensive purposes, it’s natural and often pr ofitable for
them to take on some extra risk.” Just who is the enemy here? Is there any
risk of collateral damage? Instead of interr ogating its own metaphors, however, the Times instead solicited the opinion of Walter Shipley, chair of
Chemical Bank, which the paper acknowledged to be “a lar ge derivatives
dealer,” who declared that “all of the r egulators…have fundamentally affir med that most of the market functions r esponsibly.”
“Responsible” users look to derivatives to shield them against volatility,
particularly in inter est rate and curr ency markets — a private, marketbased attempt to solve the social problem of profound economic uncertainty. MNCs do business in scor es of currencies, and have debts in quite
a few too. Volatile curr ency and debt markets make good financial pr ojections impossible, but if firms hedge properly with derivatives, they can
theoretically insulate themselves against such risks. 20
The irony of these individualized appr oaches to risk management is
that they seem to increase systemic risk even as they lower individual risk,
at least for the smarter or luckier or mor e practiced users. People who
think they’re hedged can tur n out not to be when markets go wild; all the
assumptions on which they’ve based their positions fall to pieces. Normal
price relationships — between long and short interest rates, or between
two currencies that nor mally trade in near -unison — fall apart; vast imbalances between supply and demand can r esult in wide spreads between
bid and asked prices; and liquidity may disappear (a market can suddenly
become all sellers, no buyers). Prices gap and car een in ways that com40

INSTRUMENTS

puters can’t model. But since many custom derivatives do not trade on the
open market, there’s no fair way to price them; a gr eat deal of guessing is
at work. (Derivatives portfolios are often priced to model — they’re carried on their owners’ books at the price the computer deems rational,
rather than any price arrived at thr ough open trading.)
When things go wrong, as they did in 1994, seemingly prudent hedges
can generate losses, and selective hedges even bigger ones. The 1994 losses
resulted in a marked slowdown of OTC derivatives growth in that year;
whether this is a pause for breath or a r eal leveling off is an open question. Historically, new futur es contracts have typically started slowly, then
grown rapidly, and then leveled off; it may be that the OTC derivatives
world is now rounding the top of this classic S-curve.
While derivatives goose up systemic risk, expose central banks to huge
potential losses, and provide often illusory benefits to users at great profit
to their makers, they seem innocent of the charge of increasing volatility.
There’s no significant dif ference between pre- and post-1980 stock mar ket volatility; Treasury bill volatility was lower after 1980 than befor e.21
Volatility was lower in stocks from 1990 to early 1995 than in any five-year
period since the late 1940s; inter est rate volatility was higher, but still only
half the 1950s average. Curr encies, of course, are a major exception, but
they were once fixed by decree and then fr eed, so their derivatives boom
is clearly a r eaction to fundamentals, not a cause of incr eased volatility.
currencies
Trading in curr encies is the largest and probably the oldest market of all. It
used to be that the buying and selling of foreign exchange (a/k/a forex or
FX) was an inter mediate process, a step between, say, liquidating a U.S.
Treasury bond and buying shar es of Matsushita in its place, or between a
multinational corporation’s taking its pr ofits in German marks and shipping them back to headquarters in London. Now, however, hedge funds,
pension funds, and other institutional investors have incr easingly been
treating for eign exchange as an asset class in itself, separate fr om any underlying stock or bond (Bank for Inter national Settlements 1993, p. 7).
That means that trading in money itself, rather than monetary claims on
underlying r eal assets, is now one of the most fashionable strategies available to big-time plungers.
Trade in for eign curr encies is ancient — and not only in coins and bills,
but in financial exotica. As Mar cello de Cecco (1992a) noted, Aristote41

WALL STREET

lian, 22 Christian, and Islamic r estrictions on usury pr ompted clever forex
transactions, so priced and structur ed as to allow the furtive bearing of
inter est. That means that fr om the outset, FX markets were only partly
about the cross-border trade in r eal goods; financial considerations have
long been central.
With the breakup of the Roman empire, curr encies proliferated, as did
opportunities to profit from their exchange and transfor mation. Italians
were well placed to profit from the new trade — Italy being the center of
the former empire, and also the home of the church doctors, who were
adept at devising schemes for evading usury prohibitions. As the church
ban began to lose its bite, and as the center of Eur opean economic activity
moved north and west, Italian dominance of FX waned; first Belgian and
Dutch dealers inherited the business, only to lose dominance to London,
where it remains, though of course there’s still plenty to go around.
In myth, the old days were ones of monetary stability, with gold acting
as the universal equivalent for all national monetary for ms. In fact, the
temptation of states to manipulate their curr encies — to declare their coins’
purchasing power to be greater than the intrinsic value of their metal — is
ancient and nearly irr esistible, and the more insulated a country is fr om
FX markets, the less resistible it seems to be. The triumph of the international gold standar d was the result of the Enlightenment and the consolidation of British industrial and financial power; the political economists
of the 18th and early 19th centuries pr ovided the theory, and the development of capitalist finance pr ovided the impetus from practice.
With Sir Isaac Newton as Master of the Mint, Britain set the value of the
pound sterling at 123.274 grains of gold at the beginning of the 18th century. That standard was suspended in 1797, because of the financing needs
of the Napoleonic Wars. When peace came, cr editors’ calls for r estoration
of the gold standar d were resisted by industrialists and landowners. In
1818, the government faced major funding dif ficulties, and was for ced to
return to the old formula. The ensuing deflation savaged home demand,
forcing British industrialists to sear ch abr oad for export markets.
The classical gold standar d was nowhere near as stable nor as univer sal as it’s usually painted by metal fetishists. W ild booms alternated with
equally wild busts. And while the Bank of England stood at the center of
the world gold market, silver prevailed elsewhere, especially in France,
which provided Britain with a r eservoir of liquidity in tight times.
And then ther e was America, which was constantly disrupting things
throughout gold’s heyday. The often imprudent, anar chic American cr edit
42

INSTRUMENTS

system helped finance the country’s extraordinary gr owth, but the system’s
indiscipline led to manias and panics in near -equal measur e.23 The Bank
of England was often forced to act as a lender of last r esort to the U.S.,
which had no central bank, and often little sense of fiscal management
(de Cecco 1992b). Had America been for ced by some pre-modern IMF to
act accor ding to modern orthodox principles, the U.S. and perhaps even
the world would be a poorer place — at least in monetary ter ms.
The U.S. went off gold during the Civil War — war , it seems, is the
greatest enemy of financial orthodoxy — and didn’t r eturn until 1879, with
most other countries following suit. That began the period of the high
classical gold standar d, which lasted only until 1914, when it was destr oyed
by the outbreak of war — a much shorter r eign than the pr opaganda of
modern goldbugs suggests. There were attempts to put it back together
between the two world wars, but countries set their currencies’ values
(r elative to gold) unilaterally, with no sense of how the values fitted together. That system collapsed in the 1930s, and ther e was no stable global
monetary order until after W orld War II, when the Br etton Woods fixed
exchange rate system was established. Unlike the classic gold standard, in
which all countries expr essed their national curr ency in ter ms of gold, the
Bretton Woods system used the dollar as the central value, and the dollar
in tur n was fixed to gold. Countries could hold dollar r eserves in their
central bank for the settlement of inter national trade and finance on the
knowledge that they could cash those dollars in for a fixed amount of
gold. The dollar, as was said, was as good as gold.
The designers of the Bretton Woods system feared floating rate systems
were unstable, under mining trade thr ough uncertainty and market over reactions. Keynes wanted a much mor e elastic system than the U.S. paymasters would permit; ir onically, though, the emergence of the dollar as
the central r eserve currency meant that world r eserves were essentially a
matter of U.S. monetary policy, and the U.S. did not stint on supplying
these. From soon after the war was over until today, the U.S. has acted as
the final sour ce of world demand. There was the Marshall Plan, global
military expansion, investment abr oad by newly globalizing U.S. multinationals, and always mor e and mor e imports — all of which scattered dollars ar ound the world. That cascade of gr eenbacks, plus rising domestic
inflation, meant that the dollar was no longer worth as much as it was
supposed to be — that is, the gold price was artificially low — and that
cashing in dollars for gold at posted prices was a marvellous deal. (No
one took more pleasure in pointing this out than Charles de Gaulle.) Strains
43

WALL STREET

began appearing in the system in the late 1960s; the outflow of gold fr om
the U.S. to London was so great during the week of the Tet Offensive in
Vietnam (Mar ch 1968) that the floor of the Bank of England’s weighing
room collapsed (O’Callaghan 1993, p. 19). The Ger man mark br oke free
and appr eciated in 1969, and r epeated the breakout in 1971. The Fr ench
cashed in dollars for gold, and ther e were rumors that Britain was next. So
in August 1971, Nixon closed the T reasury’s gold window, ending the sale
of cheap gold. After some attempts at patching the system together,
currr encies began floating, one by one, in 1973. Now the value of a dollar
or a D-mark is set by trading on this vast market.
While governments ar e not free to set the value of their national cur rencies, they aren’t as powerless as casual opinion has it. Policies to manage the major curr encies have been fairly successful since the major powers
agr eed to the gradual devaluation of the dollar in 1985 (the so-called Plaza
agr eement, named after the New York hotel where they met). Nor is central bank intervention necessarily the fruitless and expensive thing it’s
thought to be. From the last quarter of 1986 to the first of 1996, the U.S.
government made over $10 billion on exchange market interventions,
mainly to support a falling dollar (by buying lots of dollars). 24 The profits,
divided about equally between the Treasury and the Fed, wer e added to
the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund — $28 billion in D-marks, yen,
and Mexican pesos — and the Fed’s holdings of $21 billion in FX r eserves,
denominated in the same curr encies (Fisher 1996). 25
Central banks can’t change the underlying fundamentals that drive cur rency values — like productivity, inflation rates, and political stability —
but they can influence the speed and gentleness of adjustment. But it’s
worth saying a few words about those fundamentals. As loopy as currency trading can get fr om day to day, it’s no surprise that economic crises
often take on the form of a for eign exchange melodrama. Despite all the
hype about a borderless global economy, the world is still organized ar ound
national economies and national curr encies; the foreign exchange market
is where national price systems ar e joined to the world market. Problems
in the r elation between those countries and the outside world often express themselves as currency crises. Two recent examples of this are the
Eur opean monetary crisis of 1992 and the Mexican peso crisis of 1994. In
both cases, one could blame the turmoil on speculators, and one would
be partly right — but also in both cases, the political momentum for economic integration had gotten way ahead of the fundamentals. W eaker
economies like Italy’s and Britain’s wer e being thrust into dir ect competi44

INSTRUMENTS

tion with Germany’s, just as Mexico was being thr own into competition
with the U.S. The relative productivity of the weaker partners in both cases
wasn’t up to the valuations implied by the exchange rates pr evailing before the outbreak of the crisis. Something had to give, and it did, with
seismic force.
But day-to-day trading in money itself typically pr oceeds with little regar d for such r eal-world considerations. That trading in money takes many
forms. The longest-established are the spot and forward markets, dominated by the world’s major commer cial banks. A spot contract allows a
customer to buy a specified amount of foreign exchange — a million U.S.
dollars’ worth of German marks, for example — for immediate delivery at
prevailing market rates. (In practice, “immediate” usually means two business days.) The full amount involved actually changes hands. Conceptually, forwar d contracts ar e simple enough — they’re a kind of delayed
spot deal, with buyers today fixing a price today for a deal to be consummated in a month or thr ee. In practice, such straightforwar d forwar d deals
have been eclipsed by swaps, in which the two parties agree to exchange
two currencies at a certain rate on one date, and then to r everse the transaction, usually at a dif ferent exchange rate, some specified time in the
futur e. The “price” of a forward contract — the dif ference between the
forward and spot prices — is determined lar gely by the difference in inter est rates in the two curr encies, with an adjustment for the markets’ expectations of where the currencies ar e going in the near futur e. There ar e also
futur es and options contracts traded on the major curr encies, and, of course,
exotic custom derivatives are available as well.
A survey by the Bank for International Settlements (1996) r eported that
on an average day in the rather placid month of April 1995, $1.2 trillion in
curr encies changed hands, up fr om $880 billion in 1992, an incr ease of
only 45% — insignificant compar ed to the doubling between 1986 and
1989. 26 To put that $1.2 trillion in perspective, it means that the curr ency
markets tur ned over an amount equal to annual U.S. GDP in about a week,
and world pr oduct in about a month. T ur nover has certainly risen since
1992; the daily volume on the Clearing House Interbank Payment System
(CHIPS), the network connecting all the major banks doing business involving U.S. dollars, rose about $200 billion in the thr ee years after the
survey (Grant 1995, 1998) — a big number , for sur e, but one that implies
a slower growth rate than that of the 1980s or early 1990s.
Britain (mainly London) was the biggest FX market, accounting for 30%
of tur nover; the U.S. (mainly New York) was next, with 16%; and Japan
45

WALL STREET

(mainly T okyo) third, with 10%. So the big thr ee centers accounted for
56% of world curr ency trading; surprisingly, Ger many accounted for only
5% of the total, less than far smaller economies like Singapor e, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. London’s dominance of the game is r evealed by
two striking facts: mor e U.S. dollars ar e traded in London than in New
York, and mor e D-marks than in Frankfurt.
According to the BIS survey, 44% of the tur nover was in the spot market, 9% in the forwar d markets (which ar e dominated by real-world customers, doing actual trading of goods and services), and 48% in the swap
markets. (In addition, a modest $15 billion a day in FX futur es and options
were traded on organized exchanges.) Ar ound 64% of total daily tur nover
was between foreign exchange dealers themselves, and another 20% with
other financial institutions. Only 16% involved r eal-world “customers.”
Around 83% of all trades in the 1995 survey involved the U.S. dollar .
While this is down from 90% thr ee years earlier, it’s evidence that the dollar is still the dominant world curr ency by far; even something as decentered
as the FX market needs a fixed r eferent. Part of this dominance, however,
is the result of “vehicle trading” — the practice of using the dollar as an
inter mediary curr ency. Instead of someone who wants to buy lire for Dmarks waiting to find someone eager to sell D-marks for lir e, the trader
exchanges D-marks for dollars, and then dollars for lir e. The dollar is also
the world’s main r eserve currency — according to the IMF, 59% of world
foreign exchange reserves were held in dollars in 1996, up fr om 1990’s
low of 50%. As the European Union moves towards its single curr ency,
the euro is likely to account for a lar ger share of world reserves, making it
a rival to the dollar as the world r eserve and vehicle currency. Loss of the
dollar’s central r ole would decrease demand for the greenback, and would
probably nudge up U.S. interest rates, and maybe even spell the end of
the U.S.’s imperial privilege of borrowing in its own curr ency.
Though some sentimentalists still cling to the barbar ous relic, the gold
market is a fairly small one. Still, it r emains a kind of money, worthy of
discussion here rather than with mor e routine commodities like crude oil
and pig parts. T rading takes the usual array of for ms, from the spot and
forward exchange of physical bullion — done mainly with the exchange
of titles and war ehouse certificates, rather than actual physical movement
— to futur es and options on futur es. In 1989, total trading on world futur es and options exchanges alone was the equivalent of 21 times the
world supply of new gold, and about 38% of the total above-ground supply. That trading, plus trading in other markets, far outstrips the total of all
46

INSTRUMENTS

the gold ever mined (about 80% of which is thought to be accounted for;
people rarely lose or waste gold). Despite this vigor
ous trading, the world
gold stock is not that impressive. At $400 an ounce, the total world supply
of gold is worth about $1.5 trillion — about a quarter as much as all U.S.
stocks are worth, less than half the value of all U.S. Treasury debt, and
also less than half the U.S. M2 money supply.27
But not all the world’s gold is available for trading. The leading holders
ar e central banks, with 27% of the total world stock; they liquidate their
holdings periodically, but ar e not major traders. Other of ficial holders like
the IMF account for another 6% of the world supply, meaning a third of all
the world’s gold is in the hands of state institutions, even though goldbugs
celebrate their metal for its fr eedom from the state. Jewelry accounts for
nearly a third (31%), and industrial use, another 12%. That leaves less than
a quarter (24%) of the world’s gold stock — under $400 billion, or not
much mor e than the U.S. curr ency supply — in what ar e called “private
stocks,” those that are likely to be traded. London’s annual bullion tur nover alone accounts for all this easily tradeable supply, and derivatives
account for another 160%. Every grain of gold is spoken for many times,
but as long as everyone doesn’t demand physical delivery at once, the
market will behave.
Despite the small physical foundation on which the gold market is built,
the metal still has a psychological grip on financial players, who view its
rise as a portent of inflation or political pr oblems, and view its fall as a
sign of deflation and placidity. Calls for a r eturn to a gold standar d r egularly emanate fr om the right wing of Wall Str eet — supply-siders like Jude
Wanniski and Larry Kudlow ador e gold, and even Fed chair Alan Gr eenspan
professes to be fond of paying close attention to it when setting monetary
policy. Greenspan, a one-time Ayn Rand acolyte, wr ote an essay
(Greenspan 1966) for her Objectivist newsletter proclaiming gold the ultimate weapon of the haves against inflation, a way for the “owners of
wealth” to “protect” themselves against all statist schemes to “confiscate
the wealth of the productive members of society to support a wide variety
of welfare schemes.”28
Gold remains, in Keynes’ ( CW VI, p. 259) phrase, an important “part of
the apparatus of conservatism,” and in mor e senses than one. Attend a
conference of goldbugs and you are likely to be surrounded by the most
fervent denizens of the far right, who love not only the austerity that gold
symbolizes, but also the fact that it’s a non-state for m of money. In a tr emendous reversal of 19th century populist ideology, which was feverishly
47

WALL STREET

anti-gold, many of today’s right populists ar e very pro-gold, as the only
antidote to the parasitical rule of W ashington and W all Str eet. A cultural
bonus to right-wing goldbugs was the large presence of South Africa in
the industry and of South Africans at their confer ences; many, though certainly not all, aur ophiles were admir ers of apartheid. Ir onically, many leftish
South Africans now r oot for monetary disorder in the North, which would
result in heavy demand for gold, allowing the country to play the r ole of a
“prosperous undertaker at a funeral.” Though South African mines ar e
getting pretty tapped out, the six largest South African fir ms controlled
over a quarter of world gold production in 1993, with the huge AngloAmerican combine alone r esponsible for over 18%. Canada, with 8%, and
the U.S., with 7%, were a distant second and thir d (Tegen 1994).
Gold’s actual performance is a sour ce of constant frustration to goldbugs.
The metal’s main char m is that it r etains its pur chasing power over time;
should inflation soar or the banking system implode, gold will not vanish
like a paper claim. But its drawbacks ar e plentiful, and ther e ar e good
reasons why all societies have gravitated to state-sponsored money. Gold
pays no interest, is bulky, requires assay, and must be stor ed. It is heavy
and physical in a world that tends towar ds ever more immateriality. Something that nor mally does no better than shadow the general price level is
no fun, though goldbugs ar e always imagining some disaster — hyperinflation, the collapse of the state, climatic catastr ophe — that will bring
their beloved metal back to life.
For metallists, there were no better days than the 1970s. Gold first began trading fr eely in 1968, and it immediately br oke away from the classic

the Volcker clampdown took hold, gold sank almost unrelievedly to below $300 in 1985. After 1985, it spent ten years going nowher e — which
should be no surprise over the long term, given the metal’s r eputation as
48

a sterile r epository of value. Despite all the gyrations in between, the average gold price of $294 in early 1998 was 31% below 1934’s $409 (in
constant 1998 dollars). Seen in a long-ter m perspective, the 1970s merely
corrected the steady erosion of the metal’s purchasing power during the
four previous decades when the price was fixed by law. From here on
out, gold should rise with the average price level — making allowance, of
course, for the occasional war, revolution, hyperinflation, or financial panic,
should such a thing ever happen again.
innovation in general
This review is likely to be obsolete all too soon; the finest minds of W
all
Street and similar pr ecincts ar ound the world ar e constantly inventing new
instruments. At the risk of anthr opomorphizing a social convention, money
capital longs for exotic forms. One reason for this is that the highest-profit
instruments ar e usually the newest; big gains go to the inventor of a new
gimmick, but these fade as the product is imitated by everyone else on the
Street. But that can’t be the only r eason; clearly ther e’s a demand, not
always fully thought thr ough, for whizbang new tools to “manage risk,”
have a fling, or indulge some other lust for moneymaking.
John D. Finnerty, who compiled the Whitmanic catalogue of financial
innovations since the 1960s r eproduced on page 51, listed 10 stimuli to
such cr eative enterprise. They include risk reduction or the shifting of risk
towards one party or the other, r eduction of agency costs (lender supervision of management) and issuance costs, tax angles, compliance with or
evasion of regulation, changes in the level and volatility of inter est and
exchange rates, “academic and other r esearch that r esult in advances in
financial theories,” accounting gimmickry, and technological advances.
This little survey of financial innovation would be incomplete without
notice paid to the ease with which nearly anything can be absorbed into
the circuit of money. On shutting down his family’s 172-year -old London
art dealership, Charles Leggatt observed, “When I started in art, what mattered was being able to spot a good picture. What counts now is to have a
first-class financial brain. What I came into was the art trade; what I am
leaving is a financial service” (AR Tnewsletter 1992).
Art is but one example of capital’s ability to capitalize nearly anything.
The World Bank is a master at this practice; it capitalizes disaster itself. A
headline in the April 13, 1995, issue of its weekly PR sheet, World Bank
News, bragged, “Bank Pr epares Emergency Help for Massive Russian Oil
49

WALL STREET

Spill.” Something had to be done to contain a huge spill that would be
unleashed come the spring thaw, and the World Bank was r eady. While
many Americans think this means the W orld Bank gave away their tax
dollars, in fact the Bank was tur ning Russian economic catastr ophe into
$99 million in claims held by the Bank and its cr editors, to be serviced by
Russian exports. For the World Bank, this is all in a day’s work. It r outinely
“funds” gr eenhouse gas reduction programs — thr ough loans, of course
— in countries wher e it financed the gas-spewing power plants. It provides “Women in Development” loans in countries where gender relations, for good or ill, had been tur ned upside down by Bank-led
liberalization. It pr ovides new loans for the restructuring of old loans. For
a public institution, the W orld Bank is quite innovative — and pr ofitable.
In 1995, it made $1.35 billion for itself, and $6.84 billion for its bondholders; it had $15.5 billion in r etained assets on its balance sheet, accumulated fr om debts serviced by the world’s poor (W
orld Bank 1996).
But back to the more familiar terrain of workaday financial instruments.
Most of the nearly 100 instruments shown nearby ar e merely hybrid products assembled from several basic building blocks — conversion of fixed
to floating inter est rates or vice versa; maturity transfor mation (tur ning
long-term obligations into shorter-term ones, or the reverse) instruments
crafted to move in the dir ection opposite some other price (inverse floaters, which pay less as interest rates rise and mor e as they fall); the cr eation
of hermaphr odite securities (bond–stock warrant, bond–gold, bond–another country’s curr ency, bond–stock future); tax, accounting, and r egulatory footwork; the splitting of income streams (“stripped” bonds, ones
divided into inter est and principal sub-bonds, and then per haps divided
again between high- and low-risk); the swapping of income streams (interest rate swaps); the pooling of funds or of obligations into larger wholes
to diversify against individual risks (mutual funds, securitization); schemes
for incr easing leverage (options, futures, payment-in-kind securities) or
controlling volatility (options, futur es, swaps). From these elements, however, infinitely strange cr eatur es can be made.
Or, “Rather than developing new generic instruments,” “financial innovation since the mid-1980s has tended to take the for m of novel combinations of existing products to support complex and highly sophisticated
investment strategies…. At the same time, a gr owing range of ‘customtailor ed’ investment products has been developed to maximise possibilities for matching actual portfolio structur es to theoretically-based invesment
models” (Bank for Inter national Settlements 1993, p. 86). The mor e reality

can be made to corr espond to the pure beauty of financial theory, the
better life will be.
It’s fashionable among liberal intellectuals to tr eat “financial engineer ing” as an invention of the Reaganbush years. But financial engineering
was a favorite ter m of André Meyer, the supremo of Lazar d Frères from
the 1950s to the 1970s, who was the professional godfather of the liberal
intellectuals’ favorite investment banker , Felix Rohatyn. By that ter m, Meyer
meant the cr eation of “a structur e that somehow enabled him to wring all
he could out of the deal with a minimum amount of risk.” Rohatyn traced
Meyer’s skill at creating this artful risk–r eward structur e to his skill at negotiation. “André could peel people like bananas,” said Rohatyn (Reich
1983, p. 19).
But financial innovations ar e more than mer e bankers’ fancy; har d issues of power and risk are settled through them. Floating rate instruments
shift the risk of rising inter est rates from lender to borrower. Adjustable
rate notes protect bondholders against imprudent or capital-risking actions by management, like taking on gobs of new debt. Looser regulations
on issuance like shelf registration, which allows corporations to file general pr ospectuses to be kept on file, rather than prepare custom prospectuses for a specific stock or bond issue, allow firms to hawk their paper
when the market looks friendly.
Joseph Schumpeter (1939, vol. 2, p. 613), writing during a decade when
financial innovation was deeply out of fashion, observed that “it is one of
the most characteristic featur es of the financial side of capitalist evolution
so to ‘mobilize’ all, even the longest, maturities as to make any commitment to a promise of future balances amenable to being in tur n financed
by any sort of funds and especially by funds available for short time, even
overnight, only. This is not mer e technique. This is part of the core of the
capitalist pr ocess.”
Mobilize, mobilize — this is Moses and the prophets!
notes
1. There is a curious reticence about money, not only in economics, but more throughout
American culture — curious because both the discipline and the culture are built on an
obsession with money. Along these lines is R.C. Lewontin’s (1995) observation that the
only two questions in the famous 1994 survey of Sex in America that were asked in
private, written form rather than explored in face-to-face interviews were those on
masturbation and household income. American culture is almost as obsessed with sex
as it is with money, but the obsessions are fraught with ambivalence and denial.

guesses deliberately so — on this matter. Its annual Fact Book says only that the NYSE
“contributes to the capital-raising and capital-allocating process that is the strength and
hallmark of the U.S. economy.” The NYSE “encourages savings and investment,” “helps
individuals save for their future,” and “encourages the creation and development of
new ideas, new products and new services that build successful enterprises and create
jobs.” (On a floor tour, the exchange’s press officer used almost exactly the same words.)
Just how it does all that is left to the reader’s imagination; the NYSE’s centrality to all
these happy processes is, of course, obvious.
Ironically, the first chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was Joe
Kennedy, who made a fortune from two classic 1920s pursuits, bootlegging and stock
manipulation. Presumably this qualified him to root out other rascals.
The Mexican debacle of 1994–1995 slowed the boom a bit, but hardly killed it.
One needn’t control 100% of a firm’s shares to exercise a controlling interest. Anyone
holding 50% of the outstanding shares plus one can dictate policy, and in practice, 10%
can be enough to do the trick, especially if the other 90% of the shares are widely
dispersed among numerous and disorganized shareholders.
The smart money/dumb money distinction is very popular among Wall Street professionals and wannabes — typically people who assume themselves to be among the
smart — though academic students of finance dismiss it as mythology. In general, smart
money consists of specialists and other exchange members and celebrity money managers; dumb money, of small-time speculators among the public. Ironically, that means
that analysts and traders in brokerage houses use the behavior of their own customers
as a contrary indicator. It’s hard to place the mass of big-time money managers on the
smart–dumb spectrum. The charitable reason for such agnosticism is that they essentially are the market, since they dominate daily trading. The uncharitable reason is that
despite their alleged sophistication and wealth of financial and analytical resources,
they turn in a mediocre performance. The smart/dumb classification scheme also fits in
with the paranoid we/they mindset of many traders, who are convinced that “they”
manipulate the market, though who “they” are is not clear. A hint of who they are can
be found in the remark of an options trader who once defined a bear market to me as
the time “when money returns to its rightful owners, like, you know, the Rockefellers.”
Figures for the yen’s share of foreign trade are for 1987; reserves, 1990; both cited in

Specifically, these are repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. A repurchase
agreement (repo) is the sale of an asset done with the pledge to buy it back at a specific
time and price. Essentially it’s a loan with the underlying asset — typically U.S. Treasury paper — as collateral. A reverse repo is the opposite side of this transaction.
According to Fed regulations, banks must keep a specified percentage of deposits either as vault cash or on deposit with the central bank. The requirement is a constraint
on the share of deposits that banks can lend out. Banks with reserves in excess of those
required by the Fed — usually small banks with more deposits than lending outlets —
lend money to those short of reserves, generally the larger banks, who often have more
would-be borrowers than they can satisfy, from manufacturing companies eager to
build inventory to financial operators and real estate developers.
In practice, the gap is usually narrower, because municipal debt is not as safe as U.S.
Treasury bonds. In 1995, the best muni bonds, rated Aaa by Moody’s, paid an average
of 5.80%, while long-term Treasuries paid 6.93%.

jointly concocted by MBAs and theoretical physicists to lose at that game.
13. Anyone who thinks an option on a future is too abstract to exist is obviously not schooled
in the higher financial consciousness.
14. An old Wall Street rhyme says of short-selling: “He who sells what isn’t his’n/Buys it
back or goes to prison.”
15. What follows describes futures markets, but options markets are very similar.
16. Long before stock options were traded on exchanges, stock warrants were traded on
the NYSE and other exchanges.Warrants are essentially long-term options to buy a
stock, with maturities typically measured in years rather than months; they’re frequently
attached to new bond issues to make them more attractive.
17. Note that public sector institutions were the pioneers of swap techniques.
18. Briese’s figures are based on September 28, 1993, filings with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, reported in Commitments of Traders.
19. A study of 675 mutual funds showed no “statistically or economically significant” differences in returns between funds that used derivatives and those that didn’t (Koski
and Pontiff 1996).
20. One of Chase Manhattan’s top risk managers was a designer on the Chernobyl team.
The ex-designer, a mathematician and physicist named Victor Makarov, kept an eye on
some of Chase’s positions in 36 currencies, bonds, loans, stocks, and derivatives; his
history, he says, made him especially risk-averse (Lipin 1994).
21. Volatility is measured by the standard deviation of yearly percentage changes; 1980 is
as good a dividing time as any between the New Era and the Old. Interest derivatives
began trading in 1977; stock derivatives in 1981; 1980 also marked the first bite of
Volcker’s sadomonetarism, was about the midpoint of financial deregulation, and was
the eve of the Reagan transformation.
22. “Aristotle thought that only living beings could bear fruit. Money, not a living being,
was by its nature barren, and any attempt to make it bear fruit (tokos, in Greek, the
same word used for interest), was a crime against nature” (de Cecco 1992a).
23. Nearly half of the late 19th century in the U.S. was spent in periods of recession or
depression; since World War II, only about a fifth of the time has been.
24. The Fed does not make it easy to get this information. Calls to the press office inquiring
about profits and losses from FX interventions are met with the declaration that the Fed
isn’t in that business to make money, and no further help is offered. My research assistant, Josh Mason, was able to put together figures going back to 1986 at the New York
Fed library, but the staff made it very hard to get earlier information.
25. Dollar policy is the only area where the Fed takes instructions from the elected government, specifically the Secretary of the Treasury. On domestic monetary policy the Fed
is largely its own boss. The ESF was tapped by the Clinton administration for the 1995
Mexican bailout, when it was prevented by Congress from using conventional sources
of funding.
26. These figures are adjusted to eliminate all forms of double-counting (i.e., in which the
same trade might be reported by both sides and counted twice). Gross reported turnover, before this adjustment, was nearly $1.4 trillion.
27. U.S. figures are end-1994. Governments typically value gold reserves at well below
market rates; the Fed values U.S. gold at $42.22 an ounce.
28. Greenspan no longer speaks with that clarity, though his preference for near-zero inflation speaks for him. In his essay for Rand, Greenspan denounced government borrowing in what for him are heated terms, but now in his role as Fed chief he is banker
to the Treasury and responsible for maintaining the orderliness of the market for the
Treasury’s bonds. In another irony for the antistatist Greenspan — who, by the way,
has never repudiated Rand and who attended her funeral — also presided over the
54

great state bailout of the U.S. financial system that ran from roughly 1989–93. Other
Greenspan contributions to the Randian collection in which his 1966 essay is reprinted
include an attack on antitrust and consumer protection laws.

Players

Despite years of deregulation, mergers, internationalization, and other
transformations, U.S. finance still bears traces of New Deal strictures and
an ancient hatred of monopolistic big city finance. To 1933’s Glass–Steagall
Act we owe the distinction between investment and commercial banking.
Commercial banks were forbidden to play in the stock market and similarly racy arenas; they were to use their depositors’ money mainly to make
business loans. Glass–Steagall also affirmed long-standing restrictions on
bank branching, regulations that sprang from American suspicions of a
centralizing money trust. Banking emerged from the Depression a tightly
regulated industry laden with government guarantees, and the rest of the
system was sedate and fairly well-defined.
Things are no longer sedate nor well-defined. Institutional borders have
faded, bank interest rates are no longer fixed by law, and interstate bank
branching restrictions are gone. But the U.S. financial system still remains
highly fragmented. The New York Stock Exchange has over 500 member
firms; as of 1995, the nation was blessed with 10,450 banks, 2,152 thrifts,
7,361 mutual funds, and over 12,500 credit unions; in 1990, corporate
America had 51,440,000 individual and hundreds of thousands of institutional shareholders.1 Calling this hodge-podge a financial system requires
a certain taste for abstraction — though of course it all comes together
around money.
the matrix of claims
Maybe the best way to get a sense of how the hodge-podge does fit together is to use the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds (FoF) accounts as a
skeleton and connective tissue. The FoF are not as well known as the
national income and product accounts (NIPA), which measure gross
56

PLAYERS

domestic product and its components, but they’re a rich source of information on how the various pieces of the financial system connect with
each other and with the real world.
In the inelegant words of their keepers, “[t]he flow of funds system of
national accounts is designed to bring the many financial activities of the
U.S. economy into explicit statistical relationship with one another and
into direct relation to data on the nonfinancial activities that generate income and production…[and] to identify both the influences of the nonfinancial economy on financial markets and the reciprocal influences of
development in financial markets on demand for goods and services,
sources and amounts of saving and investment, and the structure of income” (Federal Reserve Board 1980, p. 2). Individuals, firms, and governments all save, borrow, and buy; the FoF accounts bring these activities
together within a single set of covers. The national income accounts have
nothing to say about the proliferation of financial claims or the size of the
capital stock; these are the province of the FoF accounts.2
At the heart of the FoF system is a matrix that divides the economy into
34 major sectors. These 34 can be boiled down into five basic sectors:
households, nonfinancial businesses, governments, and financial institutions, for the domestic economy, along with “rest of world,” a catch-all
sector that includes every player outside the U.S., private or public, individual or corporate. Each of these entities saves, borrows, and accumulates physical capital with its own and borrowed funds. All these flows
must balance in the end; A cannot borrow unless B has saved (or, in this
dizzy world, which is always getting ahead of itself, A cannot borrow unless the lender can find some of B’s money to pass along) — nor can B
save profitably if there is no A available to invest the money. All the instruments invented by modern financial alchemists haven’t altered these essential facts, even though they can bend them pretty far out of shape.
Besides sectoral data, the FoF also reports “transactions” data — the
form the transmission of money takes. Though over 50 kinds are listed in
the flow of funds manual (Federal Reserve Board 1993, p. 19), these too
can be boiled down into several major categories: insurance and pension
fund reserves; interbank dealings; deposits (in banks and thrifts, mainly);
stocks and mutual funds; credit market instruments (like bonds, mortgages,
consumer credit, commercial paper, bank loans); and “other” (loans by
brokers to customers to cover security purchases; trade credits, like those
between GM and its parts suppliers or between garment makers and department stores).
57

WALL STREET

There are two ways of looking at FoF data, flows and stocks. Flows
represent a sector’s contributions and withdrawals from the capital markets (saving and borrowing, the creation of new assets and new liabilities)
over the course of a quarter or a year. Stocks are the total value of assets
and liabilities outstanding (essentially the sum of prior years’ flows, less
losses to obsolescence, repayment of principal, or financial tragedies like
bankruptcy). The size of one’s bank account at the end of a year is the
stock value; the year’s deposits and withdrawals are flows. If the stock at
the end of this year is larger than a year earlier, then the year’s net flows
were positive.
Each sector has a basic income flow — wages for households, taxes for
governments, sales for businesses, investment income for all. This income
is then spent, with part of the money going to cover current expenses
(like food and rent for households, or raw materials and salaries for businesses) and part to long-term “investments.” These investments may either be in tangible assets (cars and houses for households, or computers
and office buildings for businesses) or financial ones (stocks, bonds, bank
deposits). In the FoF world, borrowing is considered a negative financial
investment, so the net financial investment for each sector consists of what
it saves less what it borrows.
Conceptually, all these accounts must balance; neither people nor businesses can spend more than they take in through income and borrowing.
In practice, the accounts never quite balance, because it’s nearly impossible to account for every transaction — something the FoF accountants
take care of by throwing in “discrepancy” terms. These are usually quite
tiny, and can be safely ignored. Conceptually and practically, the FoF accounts are an extraordinary achievement in the vastly underrated field of
social statistics.
who owes what to whom
Decades of financial innovation aside, most financial market activity still
involves some variation on borrowing and lending, and this section focuses mainly on these traditional areas.
A chart nearby shows that most sectors have been busily tapping the
credit markets. While the U.S. government spent the first half of the postWorld War II years paying down its war debt, households were exploring
consumer and mortgage credit, nonfinancial firms were gradually ratcheting
up their leverage, and financial firms went rather wild.3 All this borrowing

with the bull market in stocks. Though the pace of new credit-making
slowed a bit in the early 1990s, it wasn’t thrown into reverse overall; note
that the only major sector to rethink its relation with debt was nonfinancial business — though it looks like the U.S. government will follow suit
in the late 1990s, should the budget actually remain in balance after 1998.
This continued upward rise in the aggregate debt line contradicts the
clichéd picture of the 1990s as a sober corrective to the wicked indulgences of the 1980s.
In official mythology, the credit markets exist to collect the savings of
households in order to lend to businesses that need other people’s money
in order to make productive investments that allow them, and the whole
economy, to grow. In some deep sense, this may be true; debts are claims
on future growth in incomes, and under capitalism, the principal engine
of growth is investment by nonfinancial corporations. But while such deep
truths are not irrelevant, reality is a lot messier. Nonfinancial business accounted for just 22% of outstanding credit market debt in 1997, well under
the 26% share owed by households, and just a bit above the 19% share
owed by the U.S. government. These debts are not claims on future profits, but on future wages and taxes. Unlike business debts, there are no real
income-producing capital assets offsetting these obligations.
It must be acknowledged that it’s a bit misleading to focus on debts
without taking note of assets. On debts alone, households, for example,
are deep in the red — but households also have assets like durable goods,
houses, mutual funds, and stock in unincorporated businesses. Businesses

have substantial physical assets as well. There’s no level of debt that’s
magically fatal; debts only become insupportable when the incomes or
assets underlying them aren’t sufficient to cover interest and principal.
For every borrower, there must be a lender. A chart of who holds these
debts would lack the visual drama of the borrowers’ charts. It would mainly
show a rise in the financial sector’s holdings that tracks the overall rise in
debt — not surprising, really, since the manufacture of debt is one of the
financial sector’s main roles in life. Socially, though, financial institutions
are merely intermediaries; the ultimate creditors and debtors are human
beings — or households, as demographers call them. This is why the distribution of household assets discussed below matters — that is the truest
picture of who owes, and who is owed, after all the institutional mystifications are stripped away.
That, of course, is domestically speaking. In order to consume more
than it produces, and invest more than it saves, the U.S. has gone deeply
into hock abroad; another way of looking at this is that the U.S. economy
hasn’t generated enough of a financial surplus to satisfy all its borrowers,
so it’s turned to countries that have, like Japan. In 1952, the U.S. held
claims on foreigners equal to 4.2%

since Britain fell into the red after World War I. In both mainstream and
Marxist theory, international political power — call it imperialism if you
like — is inseparable from financial power, and an erosion in international position like that seen by the U.S. could be tantamount to the toppling of a hegemon — typically a period of great international disorder.
So far, U.S. military, political, and cultural power has largely failed to follow the credit line into the abyss, but ghouls and pessimists await the
dropping of the other shoe.

Let’s look at each of the major sectors — who they are, how much they
lend and borrow, and why.
households
In the national income accounts, households are the ultimate claimants in
the financial system; the category “net interest,” which appears throughout the accounts, refers to the amount that businesses hand over to households after all cross-payments are netted out. On one hand, this makes
intuitive sense; though they are undoubtedly social actors, corporations
are ultimately legal fictions, institutions that serve the pooled interests of
individuals. In the flow of funds system, though, there is no final resting
place; households are equal citizens in the republic of finance, along with
the 33 other major sectors.
Households get about two-thirds of their income from wages, salaries,
and fringe benefits, with the balance about equally divided between investment income (interest and dividends) and transfer payments (like
pensions, alimony, and welfare).4 From this income, taxes are paid and
the necessities and indulgences of life are bought. If anything else is left
over, it can be saved.
According to the FoF, households saved and invested $1.13 trillion in
1997, with around 95% of that total going to physical investment in housing and durable goods like cars and appliances, and the balance going
into financial assets. But that net financial investment figure, remember,
consists of the excess of saving over new borrowing; in 1997, households
took on $404 billion in new debt at the same time they added $491 billion
to their stock of savings. Since the net figure is positive, households can
be thought of as net providers of funds to the financial markets: they put
in more than they take out.5
Behind those bottom-line figures, however, lurk some odd conventions.
To take one important example, unlike the national income accounts, the
FoF treats purchases of consumer durables as investments rather than current consumption. According to the Fed’s flow of funds handbook (Federal Reserve Board 1993), there are three major reasons for this: (1) like
capital goods, consumer durables are long-lasting; (2) consumer durables
“provide services that otherwise would be provided by businesses through
their purchases of equipment,” and (3) durables purchases are usually
financed by debt, and the logic of FoF accounting requires some asset to
offset this debt.
62

PLAYERS

Of the three, only the longevity argument is remotely convincing; cars
and computers last for years, even though the NIPAs treat them as being
used up in the quarter they were bought. But the other arguments seem to
be motivated by ideology and convenience more than anything else.
Though they may make life easier or happier, consumer durables, unlike
real capital assets, do not produce a stream of cash in return. Consumer
debts, especially debts unsecured by assets like houses or cars, are merely
a wage earner’s promise to pay; they capitalize labor income, often at
very high rates of interest. Business liabilities capitalize future profits (in
the case of the stock market) or payments made out of future profits (in
the case of debt); they capitalize capital income.
As odd as this may seem, the national income accounts treat owneroccupied housing even more surreally. Housing purchases are defined as
investments, but since by U.S. definitions only businesses can invest, interest payments on residential mortgages are listed in the business rather
than the household accounts. Owner-occupiers are treated as landlords
who pay themselves rent, and deduct upkeep, mortgage, and property
tax payments as “business” expenses. The net return on housing investments is imputed to households as the consumption of housing services.
Official statisticians argue that they are trying to separate the consumption
and investment aspects of housing; though people do speculate in primary residences, hoping to make a killing on a well-timed purchase or
sale, most of these gains are rolled into the acquisition of a new house.
FoF accountants, free of the prejudice that only businesses invest, continue to treat housing purchases as investment, but shift most activity to
the household sector. One practical advantage of this is to expose the
sharp increase in mortgage debt relative to the underlying value of the
housing. In 1945, home mortgages outstanding were 14% of the value of
all owner-occupied housing; this rose steadily to 34% in 1965, fell gently
into the high 20s in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and then rose with
hardly a pause to a record 43% in 1997. Almost certainly, this long rise
helped bring about the steady inflation in housing prices — though rising
house prices are, in mainstream discourse, taken as a sign of a healthy
market; in the words of the late FNN credit market analyst Ed Hart, “housing inflation is the American national religion.” It also meant that mortgage creditors were taking an ever-increasing share of personal income.
This rising trend of mortage debt was aided by the invention of the
home equity loan, which allowed people to borrow against the value of
their house to finance college tuition, vacation expenses, or whatever.
63

WALL STREET

But unless people are willing to sell their houses, or turn them over to the
bank, that equity is even more purely fictitious than a stock option, especially if house prices are stagnant or declining. If the owner–occupier loses
his or her job, the inadequacy of the home as capital asset comes quickly
clear: it demands cash without producing any in return. You can’t pay the
mortgage banker with imputed rent. Or as the Fed puts it, the increase in
mortgage debt has been “unrelated to new capital formation” (Federal
Reserve Board 1980, p. 31), a formulation that if carried to the extreme
suggests inflation, insolvency, or some unpleasant combination of both as
its ultimate resolution. Carried short of that apocalyptic resolution, it suggests strains on personal housing budgets for all but the most affluent.
Another officially defined asset of the household sector that looks less
impressive on closer scrutiny is private pension funds. FoF accountants
treat these as being held in trust for households, which is conceptually
accurate but politically misleading: like children, future beneficiaries have
little or no say in how their trust funds are managed. And only a minority
— about 40% and falling — of workers are in pension plans. According to
Ed Wolff’s (1996) examination of Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF),
the bottom 90% of the population held just 38% of pension assets in 1992.

debts sink to the bottom, wealth rises to the top
For all their virtues, the FoF accounts do erase all distinctions among the
members of a sector. This is always a danger with aggregate data, but it’s
especially dangerous with households. While it is true, for example, that
households are net providers of funds to to other sectors, not all households keep their ledgers in black ink.6 According to the 1992 SCF
(Kennickell and Starr-McCluer 1994), 30% of families with incomes under
$10,000 had no financial assets at all, as did 12% of those in the $10–
25,000 range; overall, almost one in 10 American families had nothing in
the bank, figuratively speaking. The median assets of all families having
assets was $13,100 — compared to a median of $17,600 in debts, for the
three-quarters of all households carrying debts.7
Back in the 1980s, you used to read about the rising debt burden on
households; for some reason, you don’t read about it much in the 1990s
anymore, even though the burden has continued to grow. You do still
read about the concentration of wealth. The two phenomena are rarely
seen as linked. But because of the decline in real hourly wages, and the
stagnation in household incomes, the middle and lower classes have borrowed more to stay in place; they’ve borrowed from the very rich who
64

PLAYERS

have gotten richer. The rich need a place to earn interest on their surplus
funds, and the rest of the population makes a juicy lending target.
Just how this works out can be seen in data from the 1983 survey; unfortunately, the Fed didn’t publish the 1995 survey data in sufficient detail.
In 1983, leaving aside the primary residence and mortgage debt on it, over
half of all families were net debtors, and fewer than 10% accounted for
85% of the household sector’s net lending (Avery et al. 1984). As William
Greider (1987, p. 39) put it, the few lend to the many.
At the end of 1997, U.S. households spent $1 trillion, or 17% of their
after-tax incomes, on debt service — just a smidgen below 1989’s record
of 17.4% (unpublished Federal Reserve staff estimates). This represents a

massive upward redistribution of income. The share would have been
higher had not interest rates declined sharply over the period. But this
borrowing has been a tremendous stimulus to consumer demand; between
1950 and 1997, the growth in consumer credit (excluding mortgages) financed 23% of the growth in consumption; between 1991 and 1997, the
figure was 29%, the highest of any post-World War II expansion.8
Why do people borrow? Robert Pollin (1990) concluded from a study
of the SCF that the bottom 40% of the income distribution borrowed to
compensate for stagnant or falling incomes (what Pollin called “necessitous” or “compensatory” borrowing), while the upper 20% borrowed
mainly to invest (or speculate, if you prefer). Pollin’s findings are echoed
in British experience: a survey of that country’s households concluded
that “[C]redit fulfils two different roles in household budgets. Poorer families, on the whole, use credit to ease financial difficulties; those who are
better-off take on credit commitments to finance a consumer life-style.
Both would use it to improve their lot: one to reduce their poverty; the
other to increase their prosperity” (Berthoud and Kempson 1992, p. 64).9

WALL STREET

Economically, then, consumer credit can be thought of as a way to
sustain mass consumption in the face of stagnant or falling wages. But
there’s an additional social and political bonus, from the point of view of
the creditor class: it reduces pressure for higher wages by allowing people
to buy goods they couldn’t otherwise afford. It helps to nourish both the
appearance and reality of a middle-class standard of living in a time of
polarization. And debt can be a great conservatizing force; with a large
monthly mortgage and/or MasterCard bill, strikes and other forms of
troublemaking look less appealing than they would otherwise.
Though the household sector as a whole has a steeply positive net worth,
the liabilities are found disproportionally at the lower end, and assets at
the high end of the distribution. Subtract liabilities from assets, and you
find net worth to be concentrated far more densely than income. In 1995,
the richest 1% of households claimed 11% of total income — but had 31%
of all assets, 35% of all net worth, and 43% of net worth if you disregard
the principal residence, which is the lion’s share of most middle-class
wealth. The richest 1/2% had a larger share of total nonresidential net
worth than the bottom 90% of the population (34% vs. 22%); the richest
10% accounted for 78% of nonresidential net worth.10
Revisions to older estimates show that despite the decade’s reputation,
there was no great concentration of wealth in the 1980s; the real concentration has happened in the 1990s, with the share of the top 1% rising by
nearly five percentage points. That gain came mostly at the expense of the
next 9%; the share of the bottom 90% continued its long erosion. Wealth is
now the most concentrated it’s been since the 1920s. According to Edward Wolff (1995, pp. 28, 62–63), this trend is probably the result of several things, among them the increasing “dispersion” of wages and salaries
— economists prefer this morally neutral term to the more value-laden
“inequality” — which has depressed saving among the middle class and
boosted it among the rich, and also the relative stagnation of house prices
(the main repository of middle-class wealth) along with the phenomenal
rise in stock and bond prices from the early 1980s into the late 1990s.
Ownership of the most valuable financial assets — real claims, like
stocks and bonds — is densely packed in the upper crust. In 1995, the
richest 1% of households — about 2 million adults — owned 42% of the
stock owned by individuals, and 56% of the bonds (Kennickell and
Woodburn 1997); the top 10% together own nearly 90% of both.11 Since
households own about half of all corporate stock, that posh 1% owns a
quarter of the productive capital and future profits of corporate America;

the top 10%, nearly half. These stockholders are overwhelmingly white;
fewer than 6% of black and Hispanic households owned any stock in 1991
(U.S. Bureau of the Census 1995, p. 513).
Those numbers are based on sorting households by their net worth; if
you sort households by their stock ownership, the concentration is even
more intense. In 1992 (the most recent year available), the top 0.5% of
stockowners held 58.6% of all publicly traded stock; the next 0.5%, 11.7%;
the next 4%, 24.2%; add those together and you discover that the top 5%
owns 94.5% of all stock held by individuals (Poterba and Samwick 1995).
Despite the omnipresence of stock news in the papers and on TV, especially “public” TV, the active investor population, presumably the target
of all these pitches, is tiny. In 1983, only 19% of households owned any
stock at all, and of those almost half owned just one; 4% owned two to
67

WALL STREET

four, and only 4% owned five or more. The share who traded stock was
even smaller: only 6% bought or sold a share of stock that year, and only
2% made five or more trades (Avery and Elliehausen 1986). While more
recent SCF data have not been published, the New York Stock Exchange’s
1990 shareholder survey (New York Stock Exchange 1990) showed a modest uptick in the percentage of the population owning shares, to 21%,
with two-thirds of them men. This increase looks like a bit of an anticlimax, considering the grand bull market of the 1980s. Trading picked up
somewhat more, with 12% making at least one stock purchase or sale, and
4% making five or more trades. Despite the expansion of these numbers,
the stockholding and trading share of the population is quite small — but
the amount of wealth they control is not: almost $1.5 trillion in stocks and
bonds alone in 1989.12

the transmission of privilege
Edward Wolff’s analysis of the Fed’s 1962, 1983, and 1989 Surveys of Consumer Finances showed that 70–75% of the growth in wealth over the
long term is from the appreciation of assets, and only 20–25% from new
savings — and the wealthy are about the only people who have appreciable amounts of spare money to save (Wolff 1992, cited in Mishel and
Bernstein 1994, p. 246). Elsewhere, Wolff (1996) reports that between
1983 and 1992, 57% of the increase in financial wealth went to the richest
1%, 39% to the next 19%, and just 4% to the bottom 80%.
Things were a bit less lopsided between the 1962 and 1983 surveys; the
upper middle class (the 90th to 99th percentiles) did notably better and
the bottom 80% even gained wealth rather than losing it. Even so, wealth
concentrated between 1962 and 1983. It seems to be in the very nature of
wealth to concentrate, much as interest compounds over time.
Despite myths of affirmative action and upward mobility, the tendency
of wealth to concentrate, for advantage to breed advantage, makes it hard
on people who start with nothing. Quite surprisingly, economists don’t
really have a very solid idea of what share of personal wealth comes from
savings during individuals’ lifetimes, and what share is inherited. This is in
sharp contrast to the reams of studies on the “intergenerational transmission of welfare dependency.” Estate taxes, a possible source of information, are widely evaded; also, surveys of the wealthy are rare, and any
answers they elicit would have to be taken with a grain of salt. Economists
have used a variety of techniques to simulate inheritance. Daphne Greenwood and Edward Wolff (1992), for example, using age group data from
68

PLAYERS

various years of the Survey of Consumer Finances found that younger
families had higher net worths, and older families, lower, than their saving
behavior would suggest; attributing the difference to intergenerational
transfers either during life or at death, they estimated that 50–70% of the
wealth of households under age 50 was inherited. Laurence Kotlikoff and
Lawrence Summers (1981), using a variety of simulation techniques, estimated that as much as 80% of personal wealth came either from direct
inheritance or the income on inherited wealth. Franco Modigliani (1988),
one of the inventors of the life cycle hypothesis (LCH) of savings — that
people save in their early years to finance retirement, implying that their
wealth approaches zero as they stumble towards the grave — came up
with results that were a mirror image of Kotlikoff and Summers: only 20%
of personal wealth, by his estimate, was the result of inheritance. The
major reason for his low estimate was that he counted income on inherited wealth as lifetime savings rather than as an inheritance, rather a conceptual stretch, but one essential to preserve the LCH, something he
understandably feels a personal attachment to.
During the 1980s, about half the fortunes in the Forbes 400 were the
result of inheritance, by the magazine’s classification; this inexplicably fell
to under a quarter in the early 1990s. But the magazine was probably
defining things too strictly. A study of the 1995 and 1996 editions by the
Boston-based group United for a Fair Economy (1996) showed that 43%
were born with enough wealth to make it onto the elite list; another 7%
had inherited $50 million or more — not enough to make it onto the list,
but nothing to sneeze at; 6% had inherited at least $1 million or a family
business; and 14% were born into the upper middle class. Just 30% of the
400 plutocrats were “self-made” — but they controlled only 25% of the
list’s total wealth, making them the elite’s poor relations.
Putting all the evidence together, a cautious guess is that about half of
all personal wealth can be traced to inheritance (Gale and Scholz 1994),
though one is perfectly justified at believing three-quarters.
”Nonwhite” Americans — the SCF offers no finer distinction than that
— suffer badly in a wealth comparison with whites.13 In 1992, nonwhites’
median income was 58% of whites’, but their median net worth was only
20% of whites’; looking at only financial assets, nonwhite wealth was a
mere 1% of white levels. (Wolff 1996). The racial wealth gap is vast even
for households at the same income level. In 1989, the poorest whites,
those with incomes under $10,000, had four times the net worth of nonwhites in the same income class; whites with incomes over $50,000 were
69

WALL STREET

twice as wealthy as nonwhites in the same class. Nonwhite single-mother
households had only one-fifth the wealth of white ones. Obviously this
leaves nonwhite households much more vulnerable to economic crises
(sickness, job loss) and much less capable of taking advantage of opportunities (moves, schooling, entrepreneurship) than white ones.
In mainstream speech, “saving” rarely travels without a moralizing
subtext, one that apologizes for vast inequalities by arguing that the poor
are profligate, live in the eternal present, and are unable to control their
impulses, while the rich are the virtuous opposite of all these things. Or as
Texas Senator Phil Gramm puts it in his homey way, society consists of
those who pull the wagon (his rich Dallas and Houston constituents) and
those who ride in it (the shiftless poor). The middle classes, obviously, fall
somewhere between vice and virtue. From this black-is-white premise, it
follows that the rich should be lightly taxed, and the poor, soaked; this is
the rationale behind consumption taxes, like sales taxes and VATs, which
spare the saver and punish the consumer.
But according to SCF data, only 57% of households — 61% of “white
non-Hispanics” and 44% of “Nonwhites or Hispanics” (Kennickell and StarrMcCluer 1994) — saved in 1989. Most people reported saving for “liquidity” purposes, like illness and unemployment; next came retirement and
education. In America, private savings substitute for a welfare state, to the
great disadvantage of the nonwealthy.
Another look at savings comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES). These findings must be regarded as very
rough approximations of actual experience. While some people in the
lowest income bracket are just temporarily down on their luck, and are
able to draw on savings or family help, most people cannot consume more
than twice their income for very long. The table’s report that they do is
probably wrong. Poor people work off the books, and hide it from Census enumerators. Rich people are almost certainly undersampled, and those
who are surveyed heavily understate their income. The U.S. has a low
savings rate, but it’s not 0.7% of income. Incomes are probably understated at the bottom and the top, meaning that low-end “dissaving” is
smaller and high-end saving, higher than they appear.
Still, the overall patterns are undoubtedly correct, though of course
boilerplate caveats about exceptions to every rule apply. On average, poor
people consume all their income and then some; middle-income people
come out more or less flat; and only the well-off save significant amounts.
Young people usually start out borrowing heavily, accumulate savings into

there is “no evidence that net worth decreased among the oldest age groups
within any income group,” at least in 1991 (U.S. Bureau of the Census
1994b, pp. x-xi); in fact, there’s some evidence that older households continue to save (Menchik and David 1983). The American dream, if you believe estate schemer Barry Kaye’s TV ads, is to die rich and tax-free.

WALL STREET

nonfinancial business
Like households, businesses have incomes, which they devote to current
expenses and to investments. If they need extra, they can borrow, like
households, or sell stock to outside investors. The need to borrow and
sell stock is said to be a “discipline” on corporate behavior: poor managers will find it difficult and/or expensive to borrow money or sell stock,
while sharp managers will find eager investors camping on their doorsteps. These alternatives will presumably reward good managers and discipline bad ones, forcing the hapless or incompetent to improve performance
or find themselves shut out of the financial markets.
While these influences do operate on some level, the significance of
external financing is greatly exaggerated, as the table on page 75 shows.14
Either the U.S. financial markets function very badly, and good investments are not made because external finance is wanting, or nonfinancial
businesses don’t want to make the investments. Capital expenditures —
capex, in Wall Street jargon — rose as a share of GDP during the Golden
Age and even into the troubled 1970s, peaking late that decade and early
the next, and then drifting downward through the Reagan boom and Bush
slump. Things perked up in the Clinton era, but not by much.
Almost all of this investment — about 92% of the total between 1952
and 1997 — was paid for by the firms’ own cash. Or to turn that notion
upside down, the financing gap — the difference between the nonfinancial corporate sector’s capital expenditures (like buildings, machinery, and
inventory) and its own internal funds (profits plus depreciation allowances), which has to be funded by outside borrowing or stock sales — has
averaged around 8% of capex. Even at the financing gap’s widest chasm,
the early 1970s, corporations still managed to fund almost 70% of their
gross investment with internal funds. During the 1980s and 1990s, it’s been
common to hear of large industrial corporations with several billion dollars in cash and no idea of what to do with the money.
And the stock market contributes virtually nothing to the financing of
outside investment. Between 1901 and 1996, net flotations of new stock
amounted to just 4% of nonfinancial corporations’ capex. That average is
inflated by the experience of the early years of the century, when corporations were going public in large number; new stock offerings were equal
to 11% of real investment from 1901 through 1929. Given the wave of
takeovers and buybacks in recent years, far more stock has been retired
than issued; net new stock offerings were –11% of capex between 1980
and 1997, making the stock market, surreally, a negative source of funds.
72

PLAYERS

But if you exclude that period, and look only at 1946–1979, stocks financed
just 5% of real invesment. This is true of most other First World countries;
in the Third World, the figures are more like those of the early 20th century in the U.S., but again, that’s because firms are going public for the
first time, not because existing ones are raising funds through fresh stock
offerings (international and pre-1952 U.S. data are from Mullin 1993; U.S.
figures since 1952 are from the flow of funds accounts).
That huge negative number for stock-financed investment after 1980 is
part of a larger phenomenon of swelling rentier claims. Nonfinancial firms
have been distributing ever more of their profits to outside investors, who
typically contribute no capital to real firms, but simply buy their bonds or
stocks from previous holders. Start with the basic distribution, dividends.
From the early 1950s through the mid-1970s, firms paid out 44% of their
after-tax profits in dividends. That sank a bit in the late 1970s, and then
rose sharply; from 1990–1997, nonfinancial corporations paid 60% of their
after-tax profits out as dividends. Presumably they saw no alluring opportunities for investing the cash in their own firms, at least at a profit rate that
would satisfy shareholders. Wall

WALL STREET

Firms have bought back immense quantities of their own stock — $864
billion between 1984 and 1997 (Securities Data Corp., unpublished data).
That amount is larger than total mutual fund buying over the period, and
twice as large as state and local government pension fund buying over the
period — the two largest stock-buying sectors. In the 1980s, firms bought
back their stocks with borrowed
credit market debt, percent of

thing an acquiring company
would have to deal with, but if the borrowed money were used to support
the share price, stockholders would be happy, and predators far less likely
to be on the prowl.
They also borrowed to do mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Between
1980 and 1997, U.S. nonfinancial firms spent $3 trillion buying each other,
38% of what they spent on capital expenditures over the period. Like
buybacks, they have continued to do this throughout the 1990s, but again
without borrowing, just with bountiful profits (and inflated stock).16 With
M&A fees, according to Securities Data Corp., running from 1–2% of the
value of a deal, bankers and lawyers raked in some $20–40 billion from
combinations alone over the period.
If you put all the cash-like payments together — dividends, interest,
M&A, and buybacks — then between 1985 and 1997, nonfinancial firms
transferred to rentiers an amount about 5% greater than their capital expenditures. These funds were then plowed into the stock market, where
they’ve contributed to its wondrous rise.
A final point: just because the nonfinancial sector, on average, financed
investment internally, doesn’t mean all firms did. Smaller and newer firms
almost certainly would invest more if outside finance were available, but
this unmet desire doesn’t show up in a FoF cell. Cash-rich corporations
pull down the averages, too. Both these extremes suggest that the capital
markets aren’t channeling social capital too well.

(1988) show that from 1970 throuh 1984 (a period of relatively high reliance on external funds overall), manufacturing corporations financed an
average of 71.1% of investment with retained earnings, with much less
variation by firm size than one might imagine. Retained earnings — those
not distributed as dividends or taxes — for firms with less than $10 million
in assets covered 75.9% of funding needs; firms in the $50–100 million
category, 78.7%; firms in the over $1 billion category, 67.9% — a variation
of less than 11% around the average. These figures exclude depreciation
allowances, the other major source of internal funds, which would be
roughly equal to retained earnings — meaning that firms of all sizes fund
most of their investments without having to resort to markets or banks.
Two things that do vary greatly by size are the portion of profits a firm
keeps rather than paying out as dividends to shareholders (the retention
ratio) and the importance of banks as a source of finance. Retention ratios
ranged from 79% for the smallest firms to 52% for the largest. Firms with
assets under $100 million relied on banks for around 70% of their longterm debt (though remember that all forms of external sources accounted
for well under a third of all funding); those with assets from $250 million
to $1 billion, 41%; and those with over $1 billion in assets, 15%. Bank
finance is generally more expensive than bond interest rates, and bankers
are generally more inquisitive, even interventionist, than bondholders, who
generally keep their distance in non-critical times. And much of the nonbank finance raised by small firms is in the form of private placements
done directly with institutional investors, usually with restrictions on borrower behavior (working capital requirements, minimum equity levels,
75

WALL STREET

limits on dividend payouts and capital spending) stricter than public bond
covenants. That’s not to say that strict conditions are unwarranted; banks
take risks by lending to smaller, less-established firms, and may even do
the world at large a favor by reining in the enthusiasms of entrepreneurs,
who can tend towards a Panglossian view of life.
Sales of new stock are insignificant for smaller firms, confirming the
big-picture figures presented above from a worm’s-eye view. Fazzari et al.
cite research by Philip Vasan showing that manufacturing corporations
with under $100 million in assets raised only 2% of their total finance from
new share issues between 1960 and 1980. It is very expensive for small
firms to prepare the legal and financial documents for a public stock offering, and, outside of bubbly times, it can be difficult to sell obscure names
to investors. Smallish entrepreneurs may chafe at the snoopiness of outside investors, the press, and Wall Street analysts — unpleasantries that
have to be added to the costs of going public.
Of course, small firms do occasionally get finance from stock sales at
moments that may be crucial in their evolution, meaning that these aggregate numbers may understate the importance of the securities markets in
bringing together entrepreneurs and rentiers. Even if it were possible to
adjust for the timeliness of a cash injection, it’s hard to imagine any multiplier that would turn Vasan’s 2% into something significant.
In sum, big corporations, the ones with easy access to the public (nonbank) capital markets, have more money than they know what to do with;
small ones, who invest most of what they earn, don’t find a generous
reception in the capital markets.
financial institutions
In theory, the financial sector exists to gather a society’s savings and direct
them towards their worthiest, which means most profitable, investment
pursuits. Whether it accomplishes this or not, finance is very handsomely
rewarded for its efforts. There are several ways of making this point.
In 1991, finance, insurance, and real estate, collectively nicknamed
“FIRE,” surpassed manufacturing’s contribution to GDP, and widened their
lead in subsequent years; as recently as 1985, FIRE was 15% smaller. In 1996,
manufacturing accounted for $1.3 trillion of output, and finance for $1.4
trillion. That year, investment was $1.1 trillion — meaning FIRE “produced”
30% more than the savings it theoretically channeled into investment.
The nearby chart shows the take of what mainstream economists call
the two major factors of production, capital (whose reward is profit) and
76

PLAYERS

labor (whose reward is wages and salaries) for the FIRE sector, calculated
as a percentage of gross private domestic investment (GPDI).17 After all, if
FIRE’s social task is to allocate investment, this is probably the most relevant measure of how cheaply or expensively it does its work. Real estate
is included along with finance and insurance because residential investment (housebuilding) accounts for over a quarter of total investment, and
nonresidential structures another quarter.
The most striking feature of the chart is the extraordinary ascent since
the early 1980s, from just under 20% in 1981 to peak at 47% in 1991, then
falling back gently to 40% in 1996. This spectacular explosion, which occurred because of a simultaneous stagnation in investment (and a decline
in its share of GDP) along with a sharp growth in FIRE income, threatens
to overwhelm the message of the rest of the chart: even in bygone years,
financiers, developers, brokers, realtors, and the rest of the gang pocketed rewards equal to 20–25% of gross investment — rather a large take
for a supposed neutral intermediary. The 1990–94 average of 43% is a
grand reward indeed.
Had the chart begun in 1929, when the national income accounts begin, the graph would be much harder to read, but its story would be no
less compelling. In 1929, FIRE’s
rewards were 28.4% of gross in- 50%

not until the recovery of investment at the end of the war that the ratio returned to more “normal” levels.
With the growth of consumer credit since the 1920s, it might be argued
that consumer durable goods, like cars and appliances, should be added
to the denominator of the calculation, since these, too, are financed
(though, of course, they produce no monetary return to their owners —
unless they’re taking in their neighbors’ laundry). While this adjustment
produces slightly less eye-popping figures, the trend remains the same:
FIRE’s income as a percent of GPDI plus expenditures on durable con77

WALL STREET

sumer goods rose from the 1950–79 average of 17% to a peak of 28% in
1991, before retreating to a more modest 26% in 1996.
In 1992, FIRE corporations filed 17% of all corporate tax returns, reporting 16% of total revenues, but 37% of profits (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1994, p. 539). FIRE’s profit share has risen steadily, from 14% of the
corporate total in 1980, to 25% in 1985, and upwards to 1992’s figure.
Manufacturing’s share was almost a mirror image, falling from 53% of profits
in 1980 to 36% in 1992.
Rewards to individual FIRE workers are usually quite generous. As part
of the national income accounts, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports
average wage and salary figures for 85 different occupational categories.
At the very top are routinely the elite moneyspinners of the field, “security
and commodity brokers,” who earned on average $108,760 in 1996. (No
doubt the brokers would have done a lot better if their secretaries and
clerks weren’t depressing the industry average.) That disparity is the widest since the accounts began in 1929, breaking the previous record, set in
1993. In the memorable year of the Great Crash, brokers earned a bit over
twice as much as the average worker; they picked up a bit on average in
the 1930s, and then began losing ground from the end of the war until the
late 1960s; in 1970, employees of brokers earned just 58% more than the
average worker. The brokerage premium has climbed, almost without interruption, ever since. FIRE workers as a whole do somewhat less well
than brokerage employees. Average earnings for all FIRE workers were
39% above the national average in 1996 — up sharply from the 1960s and
1970s, when they bounced around the national mean.
These high numbers are a bit deceptive. Hourly pay for nonsupervisory
workers in all of FIRE was just 9% above the private sector average in
December 1997, and earnings at depository institutions (like banks and
thrifts), 16% below. Tellers and check processors don’t lunch anywhere
near as grandly as investment bankers.
Though they are exceedingly well-paid, there aren’t that many people
employed at brokerage houses — just 616,000 in January 1998, or 0.5% of
total employment, though this is a considerable increase from 1950’s 0.1%
share. Brokers are overwhelmingly white men — two-thirds of the total,
according to 1990 census data. Under 2% of all brokers were black women;
25% were white women. Women occupy only about 5–10% of the top
jobs at the high-end investment banks (Passell 1996b). Less elite financial
jobs show greater diversity: almost 90% of all bank tellers were women,
and 8% were black women — more than the 7% who were white men.
78

PLAYERS

This demographic mix comports quite predictably with the salary rankings
reported in the previous paragraph. All in all, FIRE employment grew from
4.3% of the total in 1950 to 6.0% in 1996 — significant growth, but nowhere near as significant as the growth in FIRE’s monetary haul.
In one of the interesting analytical articles based on the 1983 Survey of
Consumer Finances — part of an analytical exercise that the Fed hasn’t
replicated with later surveys — it was reported that 31% of families with
incomes over $200,000 a year were “headed” by someone in banking,
insurance, or real estate, even though they represented only 2% of the
population (Avery and Elliehausen 1986); FIRE’s representation among
the well-heeled was the most of any sector.18
FIRE has created a strange economy in its headquarters city, New York.
In the words of New York Fed apologist Rae Rosen (1993, p. 23), “on a per
capita basis, each job in the FIRE sector generates 2.4 times as much output as all other sectors. The wages and salaries that are paid in the FIRE
sector reflect this degree of productivity.” Rosen’s reasoning is dizzily circular. How do you measure the “output” of FIRE? By its revenues, which
are a function of its costs. What are its costs? The salaries and profits of
FIRE. What Rosen’s numbers mean is that FIRE creates a city with a small
elite and a mass of excluded. This is what makes New York different from
many other cities, which have only the excluded without the elite. It’s also
what makes Manhattan the most income-unequal county in the U.S. after
one in Hawaii that used to be the site of a leper colony, according to
Queens College professor Andrew Beveridge (personal communication).
Lest we close this section with the implication that Wall Streeters are
without redeeming social value, here’s a kind word for them from the
New York call-girl-turned-writer Tracy Quan (personal communication):
Wall Street guys generally like working girls and were among my sweetest
clients when I was active. On the whole, they are nicer to do business with
than doctors (who are often quite vain, neurotic and selfish) — and they
are often more giving than lawyers (who pride themselves on their negotiating skills). Wall Streeters tend to be very indulgent — once they leave the
office or the pit, and enter the bedroom…. Also, they basically see themselves as hookers see themselves, which colors their humor.19

IRE: insurance and real estate
So far in this section I’ve centered my attention on finance, the F in FIRE.
The rest of this book will sustain that bias, but a few words about IRE are

WALL STREET

in order. Real estate is based on milking wealth from land and tenants,
with the help of government subsidies (in the form of tax breaks and infrastructure development) whenever possible. Its connection with construction and infrastructure puts it a mite closer to the physical world than
pure finance, but to many financial investors, buildings are just streams of
revenues — rents — that can be capitalized just like a bond or a stock.20
As an industry, real estate accounts for only about 13% of the total FIRE
dollar payroll, but 20% of employment, meaning real estate workers are
the poor relations of finance.
There’s also little here about insurance as an industry in itself, though
insurance companies are major players in the major markets, and they
control huge lumps of capital — $3.4 trillion in assets at the end of 1997.
The industry is largely exempt from federal regulation — the states handle
it — but it carries plenty of weight in Washington, as the failure of Clinton’s
health insurance scheme showed. Insurance companies are heavily represented on the boards of major nonfinancial firms; everyone wants to
remain on good terms with these rich sources of capital. Corporations
often tap insurance companies through “private placements” — custom
loans that aren’t publicly traded.
In general, insurance is the private socialization of risk.21 People buy
insurance to protect themselves against devastating things that happen
rarely. Risks are pooled across a large population, and the losses are paid
from the common pool. If the pool is large enough, the risks are fairly
predictable, meaning that insurers can invest most of their premium income in the financial markets, especially in bonds. Most of the time it is
highly profitable, as long as they can keep price wars under control and
keep their payments to policyholders to a minimum, though thanks to
dexterous accounting, the industry can make profits look like losses.
Price wars are confined mainly to the property–casualty subspecialty,
where there seems to be a pricing cycle. Firms under-price insurance in
order to take in cash from premiums, which is then invested. They hope
investment profits will exceed payout on claims, but if the pricing is too
low, they end up under water, and they’re cured of the temptation to under-price for a while. Property–casualty insurers keep their reserves in
much shorter-term paper than do life insurers; disasters and accidents can
happen at any time, but people tend to die on a predictable schedule.
Riots and natural disasters, made worse by global climatic tremors, have
recently hammered property insurers, however, and disturbed their old
risk models. One could think of this as social and environmental crisis
80

taking a financial form — an example of James O’Connor’s (1988) second
contradiction of capitalism — but like the classic contradiction, it hasn’t
proven systemically fatal yet.
Insurance companies have lost some market share in the provision of
credit, falling from around 16% total credit market debt in the early 1950s
to around 11% in 1997. Still, they are vast buyers of paper assets; life insurance companies owned almost a third of all corporate bonds outstanding
in 1997. They were major funders of corporate buyouts and takeovers
during the middle and late 1980s, though on review, a buyout specialist
for a brand-name insurance company told me his firm could have done
better investing in Treasury bills, so lousy was the return on his deals.
As financial popstar Andrew Tobias (1982) once argued, the insurance
industry thrives on its reputation for dullness, which keeps prying eyes
away from examining its wealth. So-called mutual life insurance companies, which are owned by their policyholders, are especially fat and obscure, because few small policyholders have the means or will to check
out what “their” firm is up to with “their” money. Executives of such firms
are among the most cosseted of a cosseted class, though financial deregulation is beginning to bite at the industry.

banks, commercial and investment
And now to the players that attract the most attention — commercial and
investment banks and other star institutions that are synonymous with
Wall Street. A striking feature of the general credit scene is that old-style
banking has taken a backseat to “the markets.” This is a matter of both
numbers and style. From the 1950s through the mid-1970s, banks held an
average of 28% of total credit market debt; at the end of 1997, their share
had fallen to 19%. Thrifts have lost even more market share than the banks.
They held 18% of credit market debt in 1977, a near-doubling from 1952,
but that share eroded throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, falling to
under 5% in 1997. What banks and thrifts lost was gained in part by pension funds, who have more than doubled their share over the last 40 years,
and mutual funds, who had 0.2% of all credit market debt in 1952, and
7.6% in 1997.
These asset figures are misleading, since banks still have a hand in most
financial transactions — it’s hard to sell a stock or trade a currency without one — and also since the flow of funds figures exclude banks’ “offbalance-sheet” activities — unsupervised, under-reported adventures in
leverage in derivatives markets and anywhere else their inventive minds
81

WALL STREET

might take them. At the end of 1993, the 20 largest banks had off-balancesheet exposures equal to 39% of assets and 573% of their “core capital”
(retained profits plus the proceeds of past stock sales), meaning that if all
hell broke loose many would be legally insolvent. Additionally, many banks
have extensive proprietary trading accounts (for their own accounts rather
than clients’), in which they turn over foreign exchange, government bonds,
and other fictitious claims; the 20 largest banks had trading accounts equal
to 45% of assets and 749% of core capital (computed from Sheshunoff
data reported in Schlesinger 1995). Many of these activities are not only
off balance sheets, they’re off the mainland as well, in London or the Cayman Islands.22 But the central banks would not allow all hell to break
loose, meaning that a public safety net has been placed under a market no
one really understands or can even accurately measure.23
Fear-mongering aside, whatever the virtues of off-balance-sheet financing and proprietary trading, it has little in common with J.P. Morgan’s “character” banking — making a loan based on a judgment of personal character
rather than a balance sheet — or classic credit scrutiny. Often, banks are
quick to syndicate loans — farm bits of a deal out to other banks — or to
securitize them (to package a bunch of similar loans and sell them as bonds
on the open market). And the biggest commercial banks are rapidly becoming securities firms, so their founding uniqueness — making commercial loans while being prohibited from underwriting new securities —
no longer exists. Money-center banks — the giants based in New York,
Chicago, and California — derive large portions of their profits from trading operations; merely paying your depositors less than you charge your
borrowers seems a very retro approach to the business.24 Big banks no
longer nurture long-term ties with big corporations; the big corporations
can borrow for themselves in the commercial paper market, and the bankers bid on the rest of the corporate business like traders juggling stock.
Banking is now largely an affair of transactions, not relationships.
Now we get to the rich heart of what people mean by “Wall Street.”
Commercial banks, though undoubtedly major presences in the financial
world — and which are becoming more like investment banks every day
— are still looked down on by investment bankers as dull and incompetent. The peak of the Wall Street hierarchy, measured by both prestige and
money — and money, of course, is what really matters — are the “bulge
bracket” underwriting and trading monsters like Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs. They bring forth new securities issues to their customers,
and trade them for their own and their customers’ accounts.

The sociology of modern Wall Street is worth a book in itself. It’s notable how few high-flyers from the 1980s mania made it into the ruling
class. Henry Kravis, the major figure of the leveraged buyout mania, did
make it to the chair of New York City’s public TV station and the board of
the Metropolitan Museum, the latter an inner sanctum of the Establishment — but Kravis’ father was rich and well-connected on Wall Street,
even if he was from Oklahoma (Bartlett 1991). Many 1980s hotshots have
disappeared from the headlines; one, Kirk Kerkorian, made a pass at
Chrysler in the spring of 1995, but wasn’t taken seriously, because there
was no longer any Drexel Burnham Lambert around to float junk bonds in
his name. Boone Pickens’ firm, Mesa Petroleum, is in terrible shape, and
his shareholders booted him out. Alumni of the financing arm of the upstarts, the now-dead Drexel, are scattered around Wall Street, but they’re
no longer financing a New Class’s claims to power.
In the old days, investment banking was much more about connections — who roomed with whom at Andover could determine both partnerships and client relationships. During the 1950s and 1960s, investment
bankers raised money for and offered counsel to the managers of the
American Century, and fixed fees and gentlemanliness kept competition
from getting out of control. Andover connections still matter, of course,
though not as much, but the rest is utterly transformed. Fees and commissions aren’t fixed, and neither are customer relationships.
Wall Street does business with both financial institutions and the general public, with the general public ranging from billionaires down to “odd
lotters” (literally people who trade stocks in units smaller than a round lot
of 100 shares, but more colloquially the naïfs who lose money because
they’re in over their head). Some firms, like Merrill Lynch, deal with the
general public, from odd lotters upwards to rich individuals and institutions, while some, like Morgan Stanley, deal with only institutions and the
very rich. Since fixed commissions were abolished in 1975, an industry of
discount brokers has sprouted, dealing mainly with the general public.
They offer little or no research from professional analysts, and their brokers don’t give investment advice. At the bottom of the heap are bucket
shops, boiler rooms, and hawkers of cheap penny stocks. These operations range from the negligently optimistic to the outright criminal, and
show a special fondness for locating in places like Long Island, Florida,
and Vancouver.
This survey excludes the lowlifes who take in $200–300 billion a year
by preying on the poor and desperate — brokers who demand 20% on a
83

WALL STREET

second mortgage, pawn shops who charge 240% on loans, finance companies who charge 300%, check-cashing services that charge 2,000% for
quick “payday” loans, layaway artists and rent-to-own schemers (Hudson
1996). While they’re undoubtedly part of the financial industry, I’ll ignore
them; the point of this book is to tar the folks with the good reputations, if
only to preempt the “bad apple” defense.

funds of several sorts
Individuals who deal with brokers can trade stocks, bonds, options, and
other exotic instruments, but many also turn to mutual funds and other
managed investment vehicles to do the research and trading work for them.
Mutual funds have grown steadily since Wall Street recovered its reputation after the Depression — 11% a year on average through the 1960s and
1970s, and about twice that ever since. The 1990s have been notable not
only for the continued rush of dollars into mutual funds as people despaired of low interest rates — with many of them plunging into bond and
foreign stock markets completely unaware of the risks involved, though
with dreams of 20–30% returns in perpetuity — but also the sheer proliferation of entities. As of February 1998, there were 6,867 U.S. mutual funds
(far more stocks than are listed on the New York Stock Exchange), more
than double 1990’s number, a birthrate of almost two funds per business
day. From 1991 to 1997, $992 billion flowed into mutual funds, well over
half of new savings over the period, and even exceeding the fresh supply
of savings in several quarters. It is one of the most remarkable financial
developments of modern times — assuming it lasts, and that it’s not a
bubble of sublime proportions, like the Japanese financial markets were
in 1989.25
Mutual funds collect money from public investors, use a bit of it to hire
managers who select securities and trade them. (A “bit” from the big picture perspective, perhaps, but considering the small staff it takes to manage big bucks, a thin slice of a massive pile means the managers and
directors are paid very very well.) Styles vary; some funds are aggressive,
some conservative; some invest only in bonds, or stocks, or certain kinds
of bonds (municipal, Treasury) or stocks (medical companies, new or small
companies), or certain regions (Mexico, Asia). There is a huge industry
about them, too — TV shows, software, websites, newsletters. Mutual funds
have become the favorite indoor sport of the upper half.
“Hedge funds” might be thought of as high-end mutual funds.26 Though
there’s no strict definition of what they are, in general a hedge fund is the
84

PLAYERS

pooled capital of usually 100 or fewer partners (rich individuals or institutions), led by a single manager or a small team. They’re barely regulated,
if at all; many are registered in offshore havens, even though they’re often
managed from places like New York and London; and can do pretty much
whatever they like with their money, from U.S. bonds to Turkish stocks to
silver futures to Moscow real estate. Since there’s no strict definition, and
since they need file no reports — even the partners aren’t always informed
of their investments — one can only guess at their size. As of 1994, best
estimates were that there were 800 to 900 hedge funds with total capital of
$75–100 billion; a small fund would be one with $75 million under management, and a large one, as much as $10 billion. Since hedge funds borrow aggressively, they can take positions anywhere from 5 to 20 times
their paid-in capital, meaning that they can control anywhere from $375
billion to $2 trillion in securities (Goldstein et al. 1994, pp. 6–9). Not only
are these big numbers, even by the standards of today’s capital markets,
but they move very quickly in and out of investments. They were responsible for much of the turbulence in the European Monetary System in 1992,
and for the U.S. bond market debacle of 1994 (the worst year in the modern history of that market), and for the Mexican crisis of that year as well.
While many hedge fund stars lost big money in 1994, their performance in
the years leading up to that plague year was impressive: an average yearly
return of almost 20% between 1987 and 1993, compared with “only” 13%
for mutual funds and the U.S. stock market (measured by the S&P 500),
and with much greater consistency as well. Such superior returns compound miraculously over time; $1 million placed with the average hedge
fund in 1986 would have grown to $3.5 million at the end of 1993, compared with a mere $2.4 million in the average stock or mutual fund (Republic New York Securities data, presented in Goldstein et al., p. 8).
Despite these returns for the lucky few, hedge funds are not without
dangers for the rest of us. Since they borrow so heavily from banks, a
really disastrous year for the speculators could do serious damage to the
broad financial system — meaning that central bankers and regulators
may face the choice of a bailout or systemic collapse. There is also the
worry that they increase the volatility of the markets, though it may also
be that their willingness to tread where others fear may help put a floor
under weak markets. Another worry is that hedge fund operators could
manipulate markets, either through calculated buying and selling designed
to mislead the general public — slowly bidding up the price of some asset, say, and then unloading a large position on gullible buyers, or using
85

WALL STREET

calculated leaks to the press to create a mania or panic profitable to the
well-positioned. The authorities play down the dangers of manipulation,
but that’s what authorities are paid to do.
A highly romanticized corner of finance is the venture capital industry,
which supplies funds to small, new firms, prominently though not exclusively in high-tech. Typically, money is pooled by institutions and rich
individuals into partnerships under the management of a small expert team.
The failure rate is high, but the successes can make it all worthwhile; everyone wants to hit the next Compaq. Rates of return run between 0% in
bad years (like 1984 and 1990) to 60% in good ones (like 1980 and 1995),
averaging around 20% since 1980 (Venture Economics data, reported in
Mehta 1996). Many initial public offerings (IPOs) are designed to cash out
the original investors; though some venture capitalists keep their money
and even a management presence at companies once they go public, the
idea is not to nurture a large portfolio of mature operating companies, but
to provide finance and guidance at the embryonic stage.
As important as that sounds, the venture capital industry is surprisingly
small. In 1995, venture pools totaled $34 billion, down a bit from 1990’s
$36 billion, and dwarfed by the stock market’s $8.4 trillion capitalization.
Inflows of $4.4 billion exceeded new commitments of $3.9 billion — well
under 1% of that year’s nonresidential investment — suggesting that the
venture industry isn’t going wanting for funds (Venture Capital Journal,
various issues). This looks like further proof that the outside financing of
real investment, Wall Street’s advertised social role, is actually a rather tiny
part of what the racket is all about.
the thrift disaster
No book on modern finance would be complete without a look at one of the
greatest monetary disasters of all time, the savings & loan (S&L) debacle of the
1980s. While hotshot S&Ls were among the most enthusiastic makers of
the great boom, they collapsed at a cost of $200 billion to the U.S. government, to be paid for well into the next century. S&Ls, also known as thrifts,
are disappearing; they’ve pretty much lost their rationale for being.
S&Ls have their roots in 19th century mutual savings banks, cooperative institutions that pooled the savings of workers to finance home mortgage loans.27 Patterned after European credit cooperatives, thrifts offered
credit to customers whose custom was refused by snobbish commercial
banks. Since a mutual’s depositors are also its borrowers and sharehold86

PLAYERS

ers, 19th century thrifts offered protection from the predations of the “monied classes” — usurious interest rates, speculative bubbles, and bank failures (O’Hara 1992). Some more conventional stockholder-owned thrifts
popped up, but a spate of failures in the 1890s led several states, notably
New York, to require that all thrifts be structured as mutuals. As late as
1974, only 11 states permitted stockholder-owned S&Ls.
Nearly 2,000 S&Ls failed in the Depression, and a third of deposits were
wiped out, though cooperative associations survived illiquidity and technical insolvency by restricting withdrawals. Two New Deal institutions
transformed the industry, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
(FSLIC) and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). The first provided deposit insurance, and the second was a central bank, to oversee
the industry and provide credit to troubled institutions. Thrifts’ investments
were limited largely to mortgage loans at fixed rates. No other industrial
country offered fixed-rate loans, since they put all the financial risk of
higher interest rates onto the lender; with floating-rate or adjustable loans,
the borrower bears all the risk (Lomax 1991; U.S. Congressional Budget
Office 1993). Thrifts were insulated from competition by limits on commercial bank deposits
Thrifts prospered during the housing boom that followed World War II.
Deposits and mortgage loans soared, though capital ratios sank as profits
lagged growth. Growing competition from banks for both deposits and
mortgage loans in the 1960s and money market funds for deposits in the
1970s drew customers away from thrifts. Worse, the inflation and high
interest rates of the later 1970s exposed the S&Ls’ tragic flaw, borrowing
short to lend long: depositors tempted by higher rates in the unregulated
world were free to withdraw on a whim, but their funds had been committed by thrift managers to 30-year mortgages. As rates rose, the value of
outstanding mortgages sank (like bonds, loan values move in the opposite direction of interest rates). Balance sheets and income statements
turned deep shades of red.
Deregulation was the answer. If thrifts couldn’t make money the oldfashioned way, they would be liberated from the ancient strictures and
allowed to enter the playpen of high finance. The Depository Intermediary Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 — passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a Democratic president, refuting popular
associations of the disaster with “Reaganism” — removed all interest rate
ceilings, and the Garn–St. Germain Act of 1983 let thrifts get out of housing and into whatever they liked. The laws and regulations governing
87

WALL STREET

thrifts had long been written by industry lobbyists, and their regulators
were in thrall to the S&Ls as well, but this cozy relationship became particularly dangerous as they were free to go wild. That wildness, as everyone knows by now, included showering money on superfluous shopping
centers in the middle of nowhere, windmill farms, prostitutes, speculative
housing, speculative office buildings, cocaine, junk bonds, art for the CEO’s
house, the Nicaraguan contras, and yacht parties on the Potomac. Hot for
funds to get into these pursuits, and subsequently hotter for funds to cover
losses, thrifts pushed up interest rates to attract deposits from Wall Street.
It used to be said that nobody got rich in the thrift industry and nobody
went bust; during the freeplay of the 1980s, people did both.
Conservatives love to point to the web of perverse incentives that
spawned the affair. Deposit insurance removed all incentive for depositors to scrutinize the thrift’s portfolio (a situation bankers and their friends
call “moral hazard”). The mutual structure reinforced this, since individual
depositor–shareholders have neither time nor interest nor expertise to
scrutinize management. Abolish deposit insurance, said the right radicals,
or rein it in, said the centrists. Of course, without deposit insurance, the
entire financial system would probably have collapsed in a climactic run
sometime between 1987 and 1990. If you’re going to insure deposits, you’d
better supervise bankers pretty closely; the price of the S&L bailout would
have funded the presence of 10 full-time bank examiners in every thrift in
the country for close to 200 years.
Financial radicals should pay attention to the lesson about dispersed
cooperative ownership: there’s little incentive for smallish depositors, or
the owners of any large cooperative, to pay attention to the management
of the enterprise they legally own. Unless there’s some institutionalized
oversight, a serious and representative supervisory board, managers can
easily commandeer the institution for their own interest. But unfortunately
for those who want to damn cooperative ownership entirely, shareholders in non-mutual thrifts did little better. One of the crucial junk bond
buyers in Michael Milken’s network was a public thrift, Columbia Savings.
Shareholders can be as dispersed and inattentive as small depositors.
Economists have their own understanding. Thrift pundit Robert Litan
(1992) rejected popular explanations of the crisis, which center on “venality, greed and incompetence,” out of professional discomfort. Instead, Litan
preferred the terrain of conventional economics — inflation, interest rate
volatility, moral hazard, real estate slump, and the rest — and, like a loyal
economist, was eager to get deregulation off the hook.
88

PLAYERS

Of course inflation and the rest are to blame. But it would be impoverishing to stop there. Litan’s fellow economists assured us that financial
deregulation was supposed to release untold energies by liberating the
self-adjusting mechanisms of the capital markets. Instead, it released imprudence, incompetence, and fraud throughout the entire system. As a
Wall Street Journal piece on the thrift disaster noted, the list of malefactors is “so long that some observers conclude there is something profoundly
wrong with the country’s political and financial systems, which appear
easily undone by feckless and reckless behavior. In fact, they say, the
behavior of this legion calls into question the performance of this nation’s
professional class itself” (McCoy et al. 1990). The “calls into question” is a
little euphemizing, and the “some observers conclude” a classic journalist’s
dodge for offering the forbidden controversial opinion, but the Journal’s
analysis is a fine corrective to Litan’s. Unfortunately, the paper did not go
into the sorry performance of the media, the Journal included, during the
1980s, as the thrifts and everything else were spinning out of control.
Every institution that was supposed to watch the S&Ls botched the task.
Topping the roster of failures are the regulators, federal and state, in the
grip of the early-Reagan-era euphoria, who failed to supervise the institutions — often run by dim provincials — that they had just set free to enter
businesses they’d never been in before. Congress had long been in the
industry’s pocket. Even a president’s son, Neil Bush, helped drive an S&L
into the ground, Denver’s Silverado (Wilmsen 1991). The administration,
with the complicity of an uncurious press, successfully kept Silverado out
of the 1992 campaign, no doubt helped by equal Democratic political and
financial collusion in the disaster.
But it’s wrong to blame only the government, despite the American
habit of doing so. Virtually every high-end profession around was involved
(a point made well by Martin Mayer [1990]). Auditors repeatedly certified
fictitious financial statements, lawyers argued on behalf of con artists and
incompetents, investment banks bilked naïve S&L managers, and consultants testified as character witnesses for felons. One of these character witnesses was Alan Greenspan, then an undistinguished economist from
whom “you could order the opinion you needed” (Mayer 1990). Greenspan
praised thrift-killer Charles Keating’s “seasoned and expert” management
team for rescuing a “badly burdened” thrift through “sound and profitable” investments. Every word of this was untrue. Greenspan’s reputation, however, survived intact (just as it did his earlier demented jottings
for Ayn Rand’s Objectivist newsletter).
89

WALL STREET

In its infinite generosity, Washington came to the rescue. Of course it
had no choice; no modern government would dare let a financial crisis
turn into a general collapse. Yet the situation is rich with irony. In the
early 1990s, Greenspan would craft the Federal Reserve’s bailout of the
1980s mania. And the braindead caretaker administration of George Bush
crafted the greatest socialization of private loss in history, the S&L bailout.
And, remarkably, almost nobody has suffered serious criminal penalties
or political disgrace for this rampant abuse of trust. Huge quantities of
public money — some $200 billion, though definitive accountings are hard
to come by — were spent with little discussion or analysis, and the affair is
now largely forgotten. The chance to use the industry’s partial liquidation
as an opportunity to develop new public and cooperative financial institutions was blown. Within a couple of years of the crisis’ passing, no
one paid it any mind any longer. It’s as if it never happened.
government, especially the Fed
The S&L crisis exhibits several roles of government in finance: to look the
other way during a riot on the upside, and then pay for the rescue when
it’s done. But of course that’s not the only role of government on Wall
Street. Governments are heavy players in the financial markets — not
merely as debtors, though certainly the public bond markets are quite
important. But government is more than a debtor; it is a heavy spender
and regulator. In the decentralized U.S. financial system, both state and
federal governments supervise and regulate finance; there is virtually no
federal regulation of insurance, which is mainly a state-by-state affair.
At the federal level, many agencies regulate finance. The issuance and
trading of securities is mainly the province of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC); firms wishing to sell stocks or bonds to the public
must register them with the SEC, disclosing a reasonably large amount of
information about the securities and the firm peddling them. Public firms
must also file their annual and quarterly reports with the SEC; such reports, along with more technical annexes known as proxies and 10-Ks,
include lots of info about officers’ and directors’ pay, business relationship between the firm and its boardmembers, as well as financial statements.28 The SEC also supervises trading on organized stock exchanges
and, to a lesser extent, keeps an eye on over-the-counter trading. The
SEC, and its disclosure requirements, were the creation of the New Deal,
an attempt to prevent a recurrence of the lunacies of the 1920s — market
90

PLAYERS

manipulations, the issuance of fraudulent securities, and the like. Though
plenty of hype and con artists still pervade the securities markets, brokers
routinely clip their customers in pricing trades, and insiders profit from
knowledge of what their customers and the general public are up to, the
markets are pretty clean — aside, that is, from their systemic parasitism.
While firms don’t always tell the truth, and do their best to put the most
positive spin on their reports, U.S. corporate disclosure requirements are
strict by world standards; it’s amazing how many junk bonds that went
bad during the 1980s contained explicit warnings in their prospectuses of
just how risky they really were. Information and understanding are apparently very different things.
To avoid getting bogged down in Washingtonia, I’ll add only a few
more words about regulators. Commodities and futures market are regulated by the much newer Commodities Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC). The commercial banking system is regulated by the the Comptroller of the Currency (part of the Treasury Department), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (which also insures deposits), and the Federal
Reserve system. State banking departments are also important, especially
the New York State authorities, since the biggest commercial banks are
headquartered there. As with the U.S. financial system — the whole society, it’s tempting to say — the regulators are very fragmented.
Quasi-federal agencies are also important financial intermediaries. For
example, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), are monsters in
the mortgage market; they led its transformation from a sleepy, localized
business into a hot, liquid national and even global one. In the old days,
thrifts and banks made mortgage loans and kept them on their books,
often for the full 30 years of their duration. Now, they’re more likely to sell
the loans to Fannie Mae or its much smaller cousin Freddie Mac, who take
the loans and package them into bonds for sale to institutional investors
and rich individuals (a process known as securitization); they were behind $1 trillion in oustanding securities in 1996 (Calmes 1996). Fannie
Mae, once a public entity created during the New Deal, and Freddie Mac,
a 1970 creation, have both been partly privatized — though everyone on
Wall Street correctly believes that they are implicitly guaranteed against
failure by the U.S. government, even though their stock trades on the NYSE
as if they were private firms.
That implied guarantee allows them to borrow cheaply, leverage up
their balance sheets, and buy loans on more favorable terms than their
91

WALL STREET

truly private competitors. These competitors, as well as the fiscally prudent, argue that the corporations’ implicit guarantees are a form of corporate welfare, for which the government should be paid, and that their
over-leveraging exposes the government to the risk of a bailout more expensive than the S&L extravaganza. To protect their privileged status,
Fannie and Freddie deploy the usual weapons with unusual skill. In 1996,
for example, Fannie Mae saw its ex-chair move on to direct Clinton’s budget office, and lent a volunteer PR expert to the cash-starved Dole campaign (while he continued to draw his Fannie Mae paycheck). Its lobbyists
include former Senators, Representatives, and White House officials of
both parties, and it throws around campaign contributions with great verve.
It makes friends in academia with the lure of fat consulting contracts (a
seductive trick also practiced by the Fed and the World Bank). The U.S.
Congressional Budget Office (1996) estimated that only two-thirds of the
benefits of lower interest rates from the implied federal guarantee are
passed through to borrowers; the rest is skimmed by managers and stockholders.29 Fannie Mae earned $2.1 billion in profits in 1995, and its shareholders have done quite well. Who says government doesn’t have the
knack for business?

the Fed
The most important government agency in the realm of money is undoubtedly the Federal Reserve. If something as decentered as a financial system
has a center, it’s the central bank, and since the dollar remains the world’s
central currency, the Fed is the most important of all central banks. All
eyes are on it, and the tone of both financial and real business is heavily
dependent on its stance. When a central bank is in an expansive mood,
finance bubbles; when it’s tight, things sag.
The Federal Reserve is a study in how money and the monied constitute themselves politically. Ironically, though it’s now an anathema to
populists of the left and right, its creation perversely fulfilled one of the
demands of 19th century populists: for an “elastic” currency — one administered by the government that could provide emergency credit when
a financial implosion seemed imminent — as an alternative to the inflexibility of the gold standard. Instead of becoming the flexible, indulgent
institution the populists dreamed of, the Fed quickly evolved into Wall
Street’s very own fourth branch of government (Greider 1987, chapter 8).
There were a couple of attempts in the early and mid-19th century to
create an American central bank, but they were allowed to die because of
92

PLAYERS

Jeffersonian–Jacksonian objections to concentrated financial power. That
left the anarchic, volatile U.S. financial system without any kind of lender
of last resort, but in booms all kinds of funny money passed.30
Canonically, it was the panic of 1907 that led to the Fed’s creation. In
the frequent panics of the late 19th century, a cabal of New York bankers
would typically band together to organize lifeboat operations in emergencies; in the panic of 1895, J.P. Morgan and his cronies bailed out the U.S.
Treasury itself with an emergency loan of gold. The panic of 1907, however, proved too much for these private arrangements; that time, the Treasury had to be called in to bail out the cabal. After that brush with disaster,
Wall Street and its friends in Washington came around to thinking that the
U.S. could go no longer without a central bank (Greider 1987, chapter 9;
Carosso 1987, pp. 535–549).
Gabriel Kolko (1963) traced the loss of the Wall Street circle’s power to
several things — the aging of personalities like Morgan and Stillman (the
Rockefeller representative); the growth of the economy and financial markets, and the evolution of financial centers outside New York; and the
shift of industry towards internal finance, which lessened Wall Street’s influence. The loss of raw financial power, however, was compensated for
by the creation of the Fed, an institution that has been dominated by Wall
Street since its birth in 1913. To Kolko, the Fed was an example of an
interest group using the state to reverse its fading market fortunes. This
line resonates in populist discourse today.
That canonical story, however, doesn’t comport with the convincing
evidence massed by James Livingston (1986). To Livingston, the struggle
for a U.S. central bank had a much longer history, and one central to the
creation of the modern corporate–Wall Street ruling class beginning in the
1890s. Livingston showed that the campaign for a more rational system of
money and credit was not a movement of Wall Street vs. industry or regional finance, but a broad movement of elite bankers and the managers
of the new corporations as well as academics and business journalists.
The emergence of the Fed was the culmination of attempts to define a
standard of value that began in the 1890s with the emergence of the modern professionally managed corporation owned not by its managers but
by dispersed public shareholders.
Though the U.S. had become a national market deeply involved in global trade and finance in the decades following the Civil War, in the early
1890s it was still dominated by small producers and banks. As any Marxian or Keynesian crisis theorist can tell you, the separation of purchase
93

WALL STREET

and sale is one of the great flashpoints of capitalism; an expected sale that
goes unmade can drive a capitalist under, and unravel a chain of financial
commitments. Multiply that by a thousand or two and you have great potential for mischief. This is one reason the last third of the 19th century
was characterized by violent booms and busts, in nearly equal measure,
since almost half the period was one of panic and depression. In panics,
the thousands of decentralized banks would hoard reserves, thus starving
the system for liquidity precisely at the moment it was most badly needed.
But the up cycles were also extraordinary, powered by loose credit and
kinky currencies (like privately issued banknotes). There was no central
standard of value, unlike the way we think of assets of all kinds, from cash
to inverse floaters, as denominated in the same fundamental unit, the dollar. “Progressive” corporate thought, which had mastered the rhetoric of
modernization, wanted a central bank that would control inflationary finance on the upswing — which in the mind of larger interests, meant
keeping small operators from “overinvesting” and laying the groundwork
for a deflationary panic — and extend crucial support in a crunch.
Trusts were one attempt by leading industrialists and bankers to manage the system’s instabilities, but those were prohibited by the Sherman
Act of 1890. The corporation, argued Livingston, was a response to the
outlawing of trusts. By internalizing lots of the the competitive system’s
gaps — by bringing more transactions within the same institutional walls
— corporations greatly stabilized the economy.
With the emergence of the modern firm at the turn of the century came
a broader rethink of the business system. Writing in 1905, Charles Conant,
a celebrity banker–intellectual, explicitly cited Marx (and anticipated
Keynes) in emphasizing that the presence of money as a store of value,
the possibility of keeping wealth in financial form rather than spending it
promptly on commodities, always introduces the possibility of crisis. In
other words, the possibility asserted by Marx but denied by classical economics, the possibility of an excess of capital lacking a profitable investment outlet, and an excess of goods that couldn’t be sold profitably on the
open market, had proved all too real in practice. A system for regulating
credit was essential — one that while operating through the state would
be taken out of politics; the regulation of money and credit would be
turned over to “experts,” that is, creditors, industrialists, and technocrats
who thought like them.
The struggle around the definition of money, Livingston showed, marked
the emergence of corporate and Wall Street bigwigs as a true ruling class:
94

PLAYERS

energized, confident, highly conscious of its mission — capable of promoting its case to a broader public using PR and friendly expertise, and to
Congress with deft lobbying. Universities became rich sources of expertise for the new class, and they endowed institutes and foundations to act
as a marketing and distribution mechanism for the new ideas.
The fight for sound money was also consciously expansive, even imperial; the economic theory of the day held that chronic oversupplies of
capital and goods could be alleviated by conquering foreign markets. Industrialists with global ambitions wanted their bankers to be international,
and wanted the dollar to be firm against the British pound rather than a
junk currency. They wanted their paper accepted in London money markets in dollars, not pounds, and that required a central bank.
The panic of 1907, rather than being the catalyst it’s sometimes presented as, was taken as the “evidence that validated conclusions [the corporate–financial establishment] had already reached” (Livingston 1986, p.
172). The elite had been agitating for sterner money for a decade. The PR
campaign heated up, as did the political campaign; in 1908, Congress
formed a monetary commission led by the blue-chip Senator Nelson
Aldrich, and the next year, the Wall Street Journal ran a 14-part editorial
on its front page (written by Conant) arguing the case for a central bank.
This institution would regulate “the ebb and flow of capital,” and stabilize
the economy. Among the elite there was a great loss of faith in the selfregulating powers of the free market; a central bank was just the sort of
expert and dispassionate intervention required to brake its frequent tendency towards derailment.
This history helps explain the absence of a finance–industry split, minor family quarrels excepted, over central bank policy in the U.S. and
elsewhere. There was remarkable regional and sectoral agreement on the
need to rationalize the banking system, both for reasons of stabilizing the
economy and to promote overseas commercial and imperial interests. This
history also helps explain populist thinking in the U.S. today, with a similar analysis often shared by left and right, greens and libertarians. Their
opposition to central banks, centralizing corporations, and global entanglements in favor of a decentered, small-scale system reflects the historical
processes by which these modern institutions formed each other. They
typically forget the volatile, panic-ridden history of the late 19th century
in their dreams of simpler times.
From its founding, the Fed has consisted of twelve district banks scattered around the country — a concession to the decentralized traditions
95

WALL STREET

of American finance and politics — and a central governing board in Washington. The district Federal Reserve banks are technically owned by the
private banks in their regions, which choose six of each district bank’s
nine directors. Of the New York district’s nine serving in 1996, three were
bankers (from the Bank of New York, and smallish banks on Long Island
and in Buffalo); two were CEOs of giant companies (AT&T and Pfizer).
The balance: conservative New York City teachers’ union leader, Sandra
Feldman;31 private investor John Whitehead, formerly of Goldman, Sachs
and the Carter cabinet; investment banker Pete Peterson of The Blackstone
Group, formerly of the Nixon administration, and sworn enemy of Social
Security; and the head of a giant pension fund, Thomas Jones of TIAA–
CREF. Recent alumni include the CEO of a large insurance company, a
small business-owner, and the head of an elite foundation. Of all these,
only two were outside the Big Business/Big Finance orbit — three if you’re
generous, and want to count the foundation executive, but foundations
have big financial holdings, and are politically and socially intimate with
the corporate class. So while the Federal Reserve System is technically an
agency of the federal government, an important part of the system is directly owned and controlled by private interests.
Despite the original decentralizing intent of the district structure, power
quickly gravitated toward two centers — Washington, where the Fed is
headquartered, and New York, the site of the most important of the regional banks because of its location just blocks from Wall Street. Day-today monetary policy is carried out, based on broad instructions from
Washington, at the New York Fed’s trading desk. The system’s executive
body is a Board of Governors, consisting of seven members nominated by
the President and confirmed by the Senate, who serve for a term of fourteen years. That long term is supposed to insulate the governors from
political pressures; in reality, it insulates them almost completely from
anything like democratic accountability. From the seven board members,
the President nominates, subject to Senate confirmation, a chair and a vice
chair, who serve four-year terms. The board has in practice been pretty
well dominated by the chair; after leaving the vice chairship in 1996, Alan
Blinder complained publicly about his difficulty in even getting information out of the staff economists. From the chair down to the vice presidents and directors of the district banks, the Fed’s senior staff is
overwhelmingly male, white and privileged (Mfume 1993).
Unlike ordinary government agencies, the Fed is entirely self-financing; it need never go to Congress, hat in hand. Almost all its income comes
96

PLAYERS

from its portfolio of nearly $400 billion in U.S. Treasury securities. It’s not
difficult to build up a huge piggy bank when you can buy bonds with
money you create out of thin air, as the Fed does. In fact, at the end of
every year, the Fed returns a profit of some $20 billion to the Treasury —
after deducting what it considers to be “reasonable” expenses. Salaries are
far more generous and working conditions far more comfortable, than in
more mundane branches of government — and there’s not much that mere
civilians can do to challenge its definition of reasonableness.
Monetary policy is set by a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),
which consists of the seven governors plus five of the district bank presidents, who serve in rotation —five of the twelve votes are cast by the
heads of institutions owned by commercial banks, a strange feature in a
nominally democratic government. Imagine the outcry if almost half the
seats on the National Labor Relations Board were reserved for unionists.
The FOMC meets in secret every five to eight weeks to set the tone of
monetary policy — restrictive, accommodative or neutral, in Fed jargon.
Until very recently, the committee didn’t announce policy decisions until
six to eight weeks after they’d been made. In a departure from almost
eighty years of history, the sequence of tightenings started in February
1994 were announced immediately, a frank attempt to steal some of the
populist reformers’ thunder. Until early 1995, those reformers were led by
Texas Representative Henry Gonzalez, who spent his few years as chair of
the House Banking Committee deliciously torturing the Fed in every way
possible. The threat of subpoenas from Gonzalez caused a sudden bout
of recovered memory syndrome at the Fed; for 17 years, it had denied that
it even took detailed minutes at FOMC meetings; in fact, it had been taping and transcribing them all along. The Republican takeover of Congress
in 1994, however, ended Gonzalez’ reign of terror.
Still, despite this whiff of glasnost, the Fed remains an intensely secretive institution. This opaqueness has spawned an entire Fed-watching industry, a trade reminiscent of Kremlinology, in which every institutional
twitch is scrutinized for clues to policy changes. Fed watchers “earn” salaries well into the six figures for such work; greater openness at the Fed
would reduce their importance, if not put them out of business, a rare
form of unemployment that would be entirely welcome. The Fed also
manipulates the media ably; reporters, eager for a leak from a central bank
insider, will print anything whispered in their ears, whether or not it’s true
— leaks sometimes designed to mislead or enlighten the markets, and
other times the product of some internal struggle.
97

WALL STREET

Even though FOMC members would no doubt invent all sorts of clever
euphemisms to express the dangers of excessively low unemployment,
televising the FOMC’s proceedings on C-SPAN would still provide an enlightening glimpse into the mentality of power.

Wall Street ideology
Since this section is about the state, some words about Wall Street’s politics. As do most plutocrats, financiers take their own, usually crude,
thoughts quite seriously, and are also rich enough to pay lots of other
people to think for them. Their opinions range from establishment liberal
(especially on social issues) to ravingly right wing; the rightwingers, all
fans of laissez-faire, can be subdivided into those whose libertarianism
extends to social tolerance, and those who are fulminant bigots. (Not all
the bigots are on the right. According to someone who used to work for
one of Wall Street’s more prominent “liberal” Democrats, he was quite the
racist in private.) Probably 95% of Wall Street — and that includes similar
outposts in Chicago and California — would agree with the mantra, “markets good, government bad” — even those who trade government bonds
for a living. Despite their reputation for sophistication, most Wall Streeters
hold to a raw, selfish view of the world.
Finance, both U.S. and international, is heavily represented on the
boards of Washington thinktanks, from hotbeds of centrism like the
Brookings Institution to right-wing outposts like Cato and Heritage. Buyout
artist Ted Forstman, a man barely capable of articulating even his own
primitive libertarian philosophy when not supported by a script, is a major supporter of the right-wing American Spectator. Financiers are quite
heavy political givers. FIRE’s political action committees (PACs) “invested
far more…dollars in the ’94 campaign than any other group of business
interests,” with the securities industry tilting heavily towards the Democrats, even in that Republican year (Goldstein 1995). While it may be seen
as a sign of enlightenment that Wall Street contains more Democrats than
do most other business sectors, in fact finance is a heavily conservatizing
influence on the supposed party of the people. More recently, hedge fund
hotshots emerged as major supporters of the 1994 Newt Gingrich Republican counterrevolution. And again in 1996, reports the Center for Responsive Politics, the FIRE sector was the heaviest political giver of all.
Even though their worldview often seems formed by nothing deeper
than the endless play of headlines that scroll by on their computer screens,
Wall Street analysts and economists are favored sources for reporters to
98

PLAYERS

turn to when they need a quote. For a somewhat more scholarly take,
reporters call experts at the thinktanks Wall Street supports. And so does
money express itself ideologically.
information: “reflexively fellative”
No survey of the cast of characters would be complete without a look at
the various financial media. Pundits and economists are fond of pointing
out that the markets are about “information,” a chic and spongy word that
often serves as an unexamined euphemism for money and power, and
not just in finance.32 But just because pundits and economists say something repeatedly doesn’t mean that it isn’t at least partly true. There are,
however, many different kinds of information.
Most precious of all is inside information, which comes in many forms.
The most famous kind is news about some dramatic business development, like an unexpected drop in profits, or a takeover attempt, or an
imminent indictment. Obviously, whoever knows this before the public
can make big money when the news hits the Street. But that’s not the only
kind of inside info that can be turned into ready money. News that a brokers’ research department is about to recommend Intel, or that a client is
about to place an order for a million shares of IBM, can be valuable to the
firm’s trading desk, which can take a position ahead of the event and
profit from the ensuing price thrust as the news spreads. The trading desk
is supposed to be insulated from the rest of the firm through a so-called
“Chinese wall,” but these walls aren’t always poreless. As a veteran financial journalist told me in the midst of all the insider scandals of the late
1980s, people have been coming to Wall Street for generations to make
money off inside info; Boesky & Co. just got too piggy for their own good.
Or as a celebrity trader once put it, “Whoever doesn’t know something
everyone else doesn’t know is a fucking chump.”
Wall Street is awash in less sexy forms of information, too, ranging from
gossip that traders pass along to each other on the phone, to seriousseeming financial and economic analysis published by brokerage firms
and research boutiques, to the daily news that appears in the papers and
on the wires. The financial wire services — Reuters, Dow Jones, Bloomberg
— have computer terminals scattered all over the financial world, pouring
live news into the eyes of easily distracted players, and offering a range of
market prices, historical information, and analysis as well.
One shouldn’t overestimate the quality of a lot of that news product.
99

WALL STREET

While the news pages of the Wall Street Journal contain some of the best
daily journalism in America, the market news in that and other major papers is often quite superficial, an uncritical repackaging of the blather coming out of the big brokerage houses. The research produced by those
brokers is typically little more than an adjunct to the sales effort. Analysts
rarely say anything unkind about companies they cover; firms don’t want
to alienate potential investment banking clients, and the analysts don’t
want to alienate their sources in management, for fear they’ll stop taking
their phone calls.33 As a result, you almost never see a “sell” recommendation; the nastiest thing most analysts will say about a stock is to call it a
“hold” rather than a “buy.”
The most famous example of the pressures at work was when Marvin
Roffman, a gambling analyst then in the employ of Janney Montgomery
Scott, dared tell the Wall Street Journal in 1990 that Donald Trump’s frightening Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City was a debt-heavy house of cards
that “won’t make it.” Trump threatened to sue Janney, and the firm quickly
fired Roffman (who turned out, as of 1996, to be wrong, alas).
That’s an extreme case. The more normal pressures were described by
John Keefe, formerly a banking analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert
who now runs his own research shop in New York. According to Keefe,
since the services brokers offer to clients are pretty undifferentiated, it’s
hard for a firm, beyond a basic level of competence, to stand out at executing buy and sell orders. So, the research a firm offers clients is what’s
supposed to distinguish it from its rivals.
But, “in fact,” Keefe notes, analysts “spend most of their time ‘selling’
their ideas to their clients, and very little of their time researching.” When
he was at Drexel, Keefe said he was expected to pay two or three personal visits a year to major clients, and one a year to lesser clients. Aside
from the personal sit-downs, analysts are expected to make a least 100
phone calls a month to clients, with some of the “more obsessive (and
successful)” ones making as many as 300 calls a month — or 15 a work
day. Obviously, there isn’t much time left over after the clients are serviced to do serious corporate and industry research.
One thing analysts rarely do is second-guess the numbers that firms
report to their shareholders, which are certified by outside auditors, typically a brand-name global accounting firm. Accountancy may have a reputation for dullness, but it can be the scene of great creativity. Accountants
are notoriously eager to say kind things about the companies they audit;
after all, the subject of the audit pays the fees. Notorious bankrupts of the
100

PLAYERS

1980s, from Drexel Burnham Lambert to BCCI to several hundred
S&Ls, were repeatedly given clean bills of health by prominent accounting firms — the very outside auditors who are supposed to provide an
external check on a firm’s numerical self-representation. More pedestrian
companies are transformed through creative arithmetic and legal interpretations into dazzling growers.
Sluttish accountancy is a long-standing practice. During the 1960s, John
Brooks (1973, pp. 160–162) reported, accountants painted a glowing picture in numbers that merger promoters wanted. Investors, many of them
naïfs, eagerly bought paper that only a few years later would turn out to
be near worthless. “By following conservative practices and their consciences, accountants could have prevented this jiggery-pokery; they did
not.” You could say exactly the same thing about the financial disasters of
the last 15 years. Had Wall Street analysts, who are presumably competent
to do so, given the accountants’ numbers a serious second look, much
recent jiggery-pokery might have been detected.34
Even economic analysis must serve the sales effort. One economist
who’d been making accurately bullish forecasts about U.S. economic
growth in 1993 and 1994, when the rest of Wall Street was unanimous in
projecting sluggishness, was called in by his superiors and told to rethink
his forecasts. (Strong economic growth is usually bad for bonds, and the
firm had lots of bonds to sell.) The economist did as told, and marked
down his forecasts. Wall Street’s favorite economist, Ed Hyman, winner of
the Institutional Investor poll for a dozen years running, was one of those
(wrongly) predicting sluggishness in 1993 and 1994; by coincidence, his
firm not only sells bonds, but he also manages a large bond portfolio.
As Keefe said, if the markets are the casino that Keynes famously said
they were, then the analysts are like lounge singers. After all, the casinos
all offer the same games and the same odds; the only difference among
them is the entertainment and decor. While there are “many analysts who
take their work quite seriously,” Keefe concluded, “many times the competition among them degenerates into a contest to see who can get the
most attention with the most daring forecast.” Other times, however, less
flamboyant analysts simply tune their forecasts to the consensus, so as not
to stand out, and thereby avoid potential embarrassment. In either case,
flamboyant or shrinking, the forecast is driven by the consensus rather
than the facts of the case.
These analysts and economists provide the raw material for financial
reporters. Here’s a view of how that trade is plied, from a long-time prac101

WALL STREET

titioner, John Liscio, a former Barron’s columnist who now publishes his
own high-priced newsletter:
Financial writers are nothing more than glorified recording secretaries.
Unlike their colleagues in other fields like theatre, cinema, food, sports,
politics, and fashion, financial writers and even columnists refuse to think
for themselves. Because they cherish access to highly-placed sources, they
serve as nothing more than conduits for the received wisdom, which is
almost always wrong…. Whatever the moron economists and analysts tell
the financial press gets smeared across the page. There’s no filter.
Imagine how ridiculous it would be if a sports writer, assigned to a perennial also-ran, persisted in printing the absurdly optimistic rantings of the
managers, owner, and aging pitching staff, and little or nothing else. Or if a
food critic’s review of a restaurant was built around the opinion of the master chef and maître d’. Asking a Wall Street hack his opinion on the economy
is like asking a producer how he feels about a play he just mounted, or a
runway model what she thinks about the new line. Yet that’s exactly how
the financial press plays it: reflexively fellative.

Historically, the financial press has served a deeply ideological role. As
Wayne Parsons (1990) showed, the dissemination of price and product
information was crucial to the development of national markets in Britain
and America from the 17th through the 19th century. Like today, some of
that information was good, but some of it was little more than shilling for
the touts of the day; the South Sea Bubble, for example, probably never
would have inflated without the help of the London press.
But more than prices were circulated — so were ideas. The Economist,
under editor Walter Bagehot, was crucial to the spread of the free-trade
and laissez-faire religion through the British elite. As Bagehot said, The
Economist, the magazine that mysteriously calls itself a newspaper, was a
great “belief producer” for the new bourgeoisie. As Parsons (1990, p. 41)
put it, “the historical importance of the financial press does not lie so much
in its contribution to the development of a literary form as in its role in
defining a capitalist language and culture: free markets, individualism, profit
and speculation. Not only did the publication of information facilitate the
growth of the internationalization of markets, it also assisted in no small
way in the promotion of capitalist culture” (Parsons 1990, pp. 27, 41).
That culture had a very narrow conception of economic news; it was
that “which impacted on the state of the market and City opinion. The
economic condition of the people…was not something which…greatly
102

PLAYERS

preoccupied the attention of financial journalists and newspaper editors”
(Parsons 1990, p. 31).
Parsons was speaking of the 19th century, but much the same can be
said today, with cable TV channels running the stock ticker all day, the
Financial Times and Wall Street Journal publishing editions on each other’s
home turf, and The Economist telling yuppies and senior bureaucrats
around the world what to think, with a heavy dose of British attitude that
insecure Americans find intoxicating. Economic news is largely confined
to the “business” section, with all the biases that implies; needless to say,
no daily paper has a “labor” section.
Further, Parsons argues, the transformation of economics into a largely
obscure branch of mathematics and the retreat of economists into the academy have left a great vacuum in the dissemination of economic ideas, a
vacuum that has been filled by the business press. The conversion of The
Economist from a Keynesian sheet to an anti-Keynesian one during the
1970s was of great importance in the repudiation of the postwar Keynesian
consensus.
Supply-side economics, a ludicrous but enriching doctrine that became
national policy in the U.S. in the early Reagan years, was developed in
large part on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal by Jude Wanniski
and Robert Bartley. Wanniski left the paper to become an economic consultant (famous for his fervid screeds promoting a return to the gold standard), but Bartley and his minions still push the early Reagan years as an
economic model for all time, with ever-increasing disregard for fact, reason, and opposing views. Many Journal reporters are embarrassed by
Bartleyism, but the chair of Dow Jones, Peter Kann, and his wife, Karen
Elliott House, a fire-breathing vice president of the company, adore it.
Kann is said to have denounced James Stewart, the paper’s page one editor in the late 1980s, for being “too liberal.” The “liberal” Stewart went on
to win the Pulitzer prize for his book on Drexel and the insider scandals of
the 1980s (Stewart 1991), and from there went on to become a big cheese
at Smart Money, a joint venture between Dow Jones and Hearst. At Smart
Money, a slick and empty personal finance magazine, Stewart overcame
his ignorance of the stock market and wrote stories naming the ten stocks
you have to own — names supplied by a money manager, James Cramer,
who just happened to own many of the stocks he recommended to Stewart.
One might think that the scads of independent newsletters, with subscription prices ranging from several hundred to thousands of dollars a
year, might be a better source of investment analysis, but they rarely are.
103

WALL STREET

The long-term performance of popular newsletters is little different from
a guess, but even the high-end ones are not too impressive either.
The consulting service Johnson Smick, which charges up to $100,000
for subscriptions to its tout sheets, is a case in point. The Johnson is Manuel
Johnson, former vice chair of the Federal Reserve. When Johnson was at
the central bank, the firm, then Smick Medley, showed an uncanny ability
to forecast Fed policy changes; when Johnson left the Fed, the firm became Johnson Smick Medley — and their prescience about Fed policy
seemed to lose some of its edge. In 1994, the firm reported to its clients
that the Whitewater scandal was about to take a spectacular turn that would
be very damaging to President Clinton; the stock and bond markets
swooned on the report, which turned out to be completely untrue (Kurtz
1994; Fromson 1994). So why would people pay $100,000 a year for such
bad journalism? Because it moves the markets when it spreads beyond
the circle of subscribers; if you hear it first, you can make money on it,
whether it’s true or not. This is admittedly an extreme example, and a
newsletter that repeatedly was very wrong would stop moving markets,
but while a service is hot — and sometimes for long after — people will
pay big to feel the first warmth.
Lower-grade tout sheets often disguise their poor performance by manipulating history. According to Liscio, who reads tons of the stuff, one of
the most ambitious rewriters is James Dale Davidson, who mixes rightwing politics with financial advice in his Strategic Investing newsletter.
Bad picks — and there’s no shortage of those — simply disappear from
the recommended portfolio from one issue to the next. Passionately antiClinton, Davidson has recommended shorting stocks of Arkansas-based
companies simply because of some imagined connection to the president.
At the time of his death, former CIA director William Colby was writing for
a Davidson SI spinoff, promoting tales of Clintonian criminality; the conspiracy wires heated up after Colby met his end in the Chesapeake.
styles of play
This isn’t a manual of investment technique, though it would probably
sell a lot more copies if it were. But a few words on how people sling
around their cash wouldn’t be excessive pandering to commerce. People
who trade financial assets can be divided into several categories. One common distinction is between traders and investors, that is, between people
who take a position with an eye to getting out of it in a time measured in
104

PLAYERS

units somewhere between seconds and weeks, as opposed to those who
intend to hold it for months or even, on occasion, years.
Another distinction is between fundamental and technical traders.
Though details vary by market, people who trade on fundamentals look
at the realities underlying price movements — broad economic developments, government policies, demography, corporate strategies. A fundamental analyst in the stock market, for example, might examine a
company’s finances in depth, or talk to managers, customers, and rivals.
Technical traders couldn’t care less about such ephemera — all they care
about is the movement of security prices, which they trace to underlying
supply and demand patterns in the markets themselves.
To a technical stock trader, it doesn’t matter whether a firm makes potato chips or memory chips. Some technical analysts do fairly rigorous
statistical work, tracking changes in trading volume or price momentum,
looking for possible clues of imminent trend reversal. Others, little better
than haruspices, try to divine patterns in price graphs that supposedly
portend dramatic upward or downward moves. Such “chartists” speak
enthusiastically of pennants, rising wedges, head and shoulders, saucer
bottoms. There is little evidence that chart-reading works at all; the patterns seen are probably little different from the butterflies and genitalia
that one sees in a Rorschach test. The economist Burton Malkiel, author of
the popular investment text A Random Walk Down Wall Street, had his
students construct mythical stock price charts by flipping coins. When
Malkiel showed these to practicing chartists, they discovered their favorite patterns lurking in the random squiggles (Malkiel 1990, pp. 135–136).
Most market participants use some combination of technical and fundamental analysis, but that doesn’t mean their performance is terribly successful. According to Norm Zadeh, who rates the performance of money
managers, only about 1–2% of all money-slingers have a consistent and
substantial record of good performance. Most do a little less well than the
market averages, which isn’t surprising, since they are the market, and
because fees and commissions shave a bit off their returns. Truly outstanding performances — the 1,239% returns you see trumpeted in ads —
are almost always flukes.
What’s the secret of consistent winners, the household names (at least
in affluent households)? According to Zadeh, it often involves market
manipulation, bribery to get inside information, and clever use of the press;
“they view investing as war,” and in war, all is fair. Investors with deep
pockets can move markets simply by moving lots of money around; strong

movements in one direction or another will attract attention from the
broader public, moving prices in a favorable direction. Star investors —
names are omitted to avoid lawsuits — will often let it drop that they think
the yen is overvalued, or that they’ve just bought gold; when the masses
act on this information, the position, whatever its initial wisdom, becomes
a winner. No unknowing chumps here.
capital unbound
So far, this review has concentrated on the U.S. While this simplifies things,
it’s hardly a fair representation of how we invest today. Capital and commodities traverse the globe with remarkable freedom. Though casual observers treat this borderless world as a recent invention, it’s more than a
little reminiscent of life before World War I. That idyllic world was nicely
evoked by John Maynard Keynes (1988, pp. 11–12), no doubt one of these
once-charmed Londoners he wrote about:
The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning
tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he
might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep;
he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth
in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world,
and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and
advantages; or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with
the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any
continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could secure
forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any
country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his
servant to the neighboring office of a bank for such supply of the precious
metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs,
bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly
aggrieved and much surpised at the least interference. But, most important
of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent,
except in the direction of improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable. The projects and politics of militarism and
imperialism, of racial and cultural rivalries, of monopolies, restrictions, and
exclusion, which were to play the serpent to this paradise, were litle more
than the amusements of his daily newspaper, and appeared to exercise al-

106

PLAYERS

most no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life,
the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice.

This attitude of entitlement and permanence equally characterizes capital’s
sense of itself today. Aside from the occasional trade skirmish, often
whipped up by politicians eager to excite domestic audiences, further global economic integration, of which free capital flows are the avant garde,
is thought to be inevitable. We’ll see if it is.
The world Keynes described first came apart during World War I, though
the global overprivileged did their best to put it back together again in the
1920s. While European economies hardly thrived in the 1920s — British
unemployment was above 10% for almost the entire decade, and Germany spent the Roaring Twenties in crisis — it still seemed as if parts of
the prewar order had been restored, and the U.S. spent most of the decade in a boom that marked the beginning of modern consumer capitalism. Capital began flowing across borders again, and bold debts were
contracted. But the old order finally fell apart for good with the 1929 crash.
How badly that world came unstuck in the Depression can be seen in
the experience of “sovereign default” — countries that went bust. Of 58
countries that issued international bonds in the 1920s, 25 defaulted between 1929 and 1935. In dollar terms, 70% of all foreign debt issued in the
U.S. between 1926 and 1929 (excluding Canada) went bad — compared
with a default rate of “only” 30% on corporate debt issued in the late 1920s.
Most of the sovereign defaulters, by the way, had good ratings from
Moody’s (Cantor and Packer 1995).
But now those defaults are a distant memory, and today’s capital markets look seamless. Statistics confirm the decreasing importance of borders for the financial markets.35 In the 1970s, the correlation coefficient
between interest rates on 10-year U.S. government bonds and German
bonds of similar maturity was 0.191, but from 1990 to 1994, it was 0.934;
Japan and the U.S., 0.182 and 0.965, respectively; and the U.S. and the
U.K., 0.590 and 0.949 (Bank of England data, reported in Goldstein et al.
1994, p. 5).36 While it would be an exaggeration to say that there’s now a
single global credit market, we’re definitely moving in that direction.
Though all this seems as natural as the sunrise, this incarnation of
globalism isn’t all that old. Most countries imposed extensive capital controls well into the 1970s. Even now, the IMF Articles of Agreement (Article
VI, Section 3) allow members to “exercise such controls as are necessary
to regulate international capital movements,” as long as they don’t unduly
107

WALL STREET

interfere with routine payments that go with trade. Though official opinion of the 1950s urged a liberal regime, balance of payments imbalances
in the 1960s led to a tightening of controls, with the U.S. trying to restrict
capital outflows and several surplus countries trying to limit inflows.
As Philip Turner (1991), an economist with the Bank for International
Settlements, noted, capital flows have tended to exaggerate imbalances in
trade. Cross-border movements of private capital were “driven to an important extent by expectations of exchange rate realignments,” themselves
driven largely by current-account considerations. Deficit countries, then,
typically faced outflows, as capital tried to beat a coming devaluation;
surplus countries faced inflows, as investors hoped to benefit from the
likely revaluation. With the advent of floating exchange rates in 1973, these
tendencies were only reinforced.
Margaret Thatcher’s prompt removal of exchange controls upon her
ascension in 1979 set the tone for the 1980s. Ten years later, none of the
major and few of the minor rich industrial countries significantly restricted
the right of their citizens to hold foreign property.
As Turner noted, things were very different the last time capital roamed
the globe so freely. One difference is evoked by Keynes’ memoir — “coined
wealth.” Contrary to the myths

1914. Returns on foreign investment were 5%, twice the return available from U.K. government bonds.
By contrast, Japan’s surplus of 19% of GDP looks modest (see chart) compared to Britain at its peak, and 5% returns are regarded as minimal today.
Since almost all these flows were denominated in gold, there was no
currency risk — unless some country was bold enough to take the wicked
step of renouncing gold. Of course, the flip side of currency risk — the
opportunity to speculate in currencies themselves (more than in the un108

PLAYERS

derlying assets denominated in those currencies), which became one of
the prime movers behind global capital flows in the 1980s — was reduced.
What inspired capital to move about then was interest rate differentials.
Aside from gold, Turner noted two other features of the pre-1914 period, a limited range of vehicles and the prominence of long-term investments in real assets. Because of the stability of the gold–sterling system,
there was no need for today’s hedging instruments like options, swaps,
and futures — and it’s hard to imagine a deep market in such alchemy in
a computerless age. There were stocks, bonds, direct investments — many
of these euphemisms for imperial claims — and not much else.
More stunning to the modern observer is how much of border-crossing
capital took the form of productive investment, either through the direct
European ownership of railroads in the colonies or through holdings of
railroad bonds. This had, as Turner (1991, pp. 13–20) pointed out, two
economically fortunate sequelae (leaving aside the social questions of
colonial “development”). First, real assets were created, assets that could
service their debts. And second, the inflow typically found its way back to
capital exporting countries in the form of demand for capital equipment.
Unlike the 19th century, the free capital flows in the 1980s largely bypassed the so-called Third World, standing the logic of conventional economics on its head. One would think that potential profit rates would be
higher in what are optimistically called “developing countries,” but aside
from a handful of favored newly industrializing countries (NICs), capital
largely shunned the Southern Hemisphere until the “emerging markets”
boom of the early 1990s. (Even then, flows were concentrated in a handful of countries — and still, flows among First World countries predominated.) Governments and quasi-public institutions like the World Bank
provided two-thirds of the finance to the poor countries during the 1980s.
But, as Turner (1991, p. 25) pointed out, “the classical function of international capital markets” — allocating funds to areas of the highest return —
“has become even less evident in recent capital flows even among industrial nations.” He continued:
In the 1950s, the United States (high capital/labour ratio) exported capital
to Europe (lower capital/labor ratio), a process that contributed to faster
growth in Europe than in the United States and a narrowing of wage
differentials. Within Europe, Switzerland (high capital/labour ratio) was
the largest per capita exporter of capital. Viewed in this light, it appears
somewhat anomalous that the United States has been the largest importer

109

WALL STREET

of capital for much of the 1980s; there is little evidence that the US rate of
return on real assets was higher in the 1980s than that in other countries.37

Turner surmises that this inflow was largely a function of the depth of U.S.
capital markets. Well-developed markets, it seems, can pervert the allocation of capital as well as lubricate it. The increasing sophistication of the
capital markets is a reaction to the post-Bretton Woods instability of the
global system. Turner concludes that “the financial diversification and
intermediation function of international capital markets has come to eclipse
the classical allocation of capital function.” Joan Robinson was right when
she said that the financial markets are mainly “convenience for rentiers.”
Things changed somewhat around 1990, however, as Turner’s paper
was published. The decline in U.S. interest rates eased the stress on Latin
American borrowers as much as it did in the U.S., but those lower rates
left investors hungry for yield. They overcame their memories of the debt
crisis and began plowing money into the Third World. Official development finance grew just 28% between 1989 and 1994 — but private finance
swelled by 313%, led by stock market investment, which exploded by 1029%.
Much of this flowed into privatized firms, particularly in Latin America. Old
1970s and 1980s debts were converted into equity in these de-statified
firms, giving foreign investors and domestic political cronies big stakes,
often at generous prices, in monopoly or near-monopoly businesses. Private debt flows, mainly bonds rather than bank loans, grew 337%, and
direct investment — taking a position in existing real enterprise or the
establishment of a new one — rose 203%. As a result, the official share of
long-term finance fell from over half in 1989 to a third in 1994.
Mexico was the poster country of the emerging markets bubble. The
wave of privatization, deregulation, and capital market opening led to a
rush of capital — $68 billion in portfolio capital between 1991 and the first
half of 1994, compared to a net outflow of $3.6 billion from 1988 through
1990. Mexican financial markets, a fraction of the size of the U.S. market,
boomed. The real Mexican economy, however, was performing poorly,
turning in tepid growth rates and low real investment levels, while average Mexicans suffered only the mildest of recoveries from the ravages of
the 1980s. When the bubble burst, the real economy fell apart under the
pressure of the austerity program designed to calm the financial markets,
and living standards collapsed once again (Henwood 1995).
The Third World’s share of total global direct investment rose from under 15% in 1990 to nearly 40% in 1993 (World Bank 1994, volume 1, chap110

PLAYERS

ter 1). That increase in direct investment in the Third World followed on a
remarkable increase in cross-border holdings among the First World countries during the 1980s, which doubled or tripled from the levels of the
1970s (Turner 1991, p. 32). According to the UN Centre on Transnational
Corporations (UNCTC 1991), unlike the 1970s and early 1980s, when direct investment grew roughly in line with trade, in the late 1980s, crossborder direct investment grew at two to three times the pace of trade.
But direct investment flows to the Third World were concentrated in
only a handful of countries, mainly in East Asia and Latin America; the
Middle East, Africa, and South Asia were barely in the picture. In fact,
that’s true of all private capital flows in general — portfolio (stock and
bond) as well as direct. Just five countries — China, Mexico, Argentina,
Thailand, and Korea — accounted for half the private capital flow total
between 1989 and 1993; add another eight (Brazil, Portugal, Malaysia,
Turkey, Greece, India, Indonesia, and Chile), and you’re over 80%. Private markets are not known for spreading the wealth.
As a series of annual World Investment Reports published by the United
Nations has argued, these investment flows are driven by the production
strategies of multinational corporations (MNCs).38 Though foreign investment is old, the truly global corporation is a relatively recent development. For centuries, direct investment was mainly the mechanism by which
the First World corporations relieved Third World countries of their oil,
tin, and rubber. Starting in the 1960s, however, with a big push by U.S.
consumer products firms into Europe, the modern MNC began to take
shape. As the 1960s and 1970s progressed, U.S. multinationals continued
to expand overseas, choosing to serve foreign markets with local operations rather than exporting from the U.S. European MNCs soon followed
suit, and during the 1980s — especially as the yen rose in value after 1985,
making Japanese exports more expensive on world markets — Japanese
firms hopped on the globalization bandwagon.
The UNCTC (1991) calls the three great geographical sources of direct
investment — the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan — the Triad. And despite the recent upsurge in direct investment in the Third World, as their
study says, “in terms of both foreign direct investment and in terms of
trade, interactions within the Triad have outpaced interactions in the rest
of the world, and between the Triad and the rest of the world, indicating a
faster rate of integration among the Triad than between the Triad and the
rest of the world.” Since the three poles of this trilateral world collectively
account for two-thirds of global product, it’s not surprising that MNCs are
111

WALL STREET

gravitating to where the market action is. As global competition continues
to intensify, eliminating the weak and increasing the stakes for the survivors, it won’t be surprising to see even further concentration of capital
and markets as the decade wears on.
At the same time, however, the UNCTC spied “a pattern whereby host
countries located in the same geographical region [emphasis in original]
are clustered around a single Triad member.” Though the Centre wouldn’t
phrase it this way, each member of the Triad has gathered under itself a
relative handful of poor countries to act as sweatshop, plantation, and
mine: the U.S. has Latin America, particularly Mexico; the European Union
has Eastern and Southern Europe and Africa; and Japan, Southeast Asia.
In a few cases, two Triad members share a country — Taiwan and Singapore
are split between Japan and the U.S.; Argentina, between the U.S. and the
EU; Malaysia, between the EC and Japan; and India is shared by all three.
According to the UNCTC, the number of countries dominated by U.S. capital
declined somewhat during the 1980s, especially in Asia, and those dominated by Japan and the EU increased.
Only about 25 countries fit into this clustering about the Triad, leaving
around 100 mainly small and poor countries on the margins. Though being a member of one of these clusters is no guarantee of prosperity, being
left out is probably an even worse fate.
So far, I’ve talked a lot about direct investment, and rather promiscuously so for a book more concerned with the financial sector than the
real. There’s a good reason for this. Stephen Hymer (1979) argued that the
integration of national financial markets into a single global system — a
process that was only beginning when he wrote this in 1972 — developed
in symbiosis with the growth of the MNC. “The multinational corporation’s
need for short-term loans and investment arising from the continuous inflow and outflow of money from all nations, never quite in balance, has
encouraged international banking and has helped integrate short-term
money markets; its long-term financial requirements…have broadened
the demand for international bond and equity capital” (Hymer 1979, p.
82). Production must be financed, and if all goes well, it throws off profits
in money form, and globalized production is no exception, meaning that
MNCs inevitably create financial flows alongside their productive activities.39 While the global markets that surround them may seem monstrously
bloated next to their real-world base, much the same can be said of the
U.S. national financial system, which has been growing far beyond its tangible base for decades.
112

PLAYERS

Just as national capital markets join together fragmented surplus and
deficit units who may be miles apart, this global market joins creditors
and debtors around the world. And just as shareholder-owned, professionally managed, nation-sized firms emerged from family-owned and run local units of the 19th century, the MNC emerged from the national
corporation. Shareholders and creditors would, Hymer rightly imagined,
develop an interest in the global function of the system, not their national
piece of it, just as they had developed an interest in their national system
more than any specific corporate piece of it.
Two pungent quotes give the flavor of this global solidarity. A senior
executive of Colgate–Palmolive told the New York Times in 1991: “The
United States does not have an automatic call on our resources. There is
no mindset that puts this country first” (quoted in Reich 1991, p. 141). Not
only Americans are so free of patriotic sentiment. “To be in business,” said
Frank Stronach, chair of Magna International, a Canadian auto-parts maker
that has shifted its production to Mexico, “your first mandate is to make
money, and money has no heart, soul, conscience, homeland” (quoted in
Bilello 1992). This is very far from the constraints on capital flows imagined by David Ricardo (1911/1987, chapter 7), the founding father of modern free trade theory:
Experience, however, shows that the fancied or real insecurity of capital,
when not under the immediate control of its owner, together with the
natural disinclination which every man has to quit the country of his birth
and connections, and intrust himself, with all his habits fixed, to a strange
government and new laws, check the emigration of capital. These
feelings, which I should be sorry to see weakened, induce most men of
property to be satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country,
rather than seek a more advantageous employment for their wealth in
foreign nations.40

Ricardo’s sentimental patriotism is a long way from the heartless, landless sentiments of Stronach and the Colgate exec. It remains to be seen
whether this borderless world is more permanent than the one described
by Keynes, or whether war, depression, and/or political rebellion will
smash the idyll once again.
Recalling Keynes, though, should caution against the common habit of
treating the globalized present as something utterly new. The share of
exports in Britain’s GDP was only a bit higher in 1992 than it was in 1913,
and the U.S. of 1996 is no match for either. By that same measure, Mexico
113

WALL STREET

was more internationalized in 1913 than it was in 1992 (Maddison 1995).
Capitalism has from its birth been a deeply international, and internationalizing, system. In many ways, the globalization characteristic of the late
20th century resembles the world of 100 years ago, with goods and capital
crossing borders with a freedom unknown since the old world broke apart
in 1914. I leave it to soothsayers to answer the question of whether another 1914 — or 1929 — is in our future.
notes
1. How big is institutional finance? In 1991, 1,291,000 tax returns were filed by individual
proprietorships claiming either finance, insurance, or real estate (FIRE) as their main
line of business, 804,000 partnerships, and 618,000 corporations (U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1995, table 847, p. 543).
2. The NIPAs also have little to say about U.S. relations with the outside world; these are
covered in the balance of payments (BoP) accounts, which, like the NIPAs, are compiled by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The UN’s System
of National Accounts covers all these bases — NIPAs, BoP, and FoF — in a unified way,
but the U.S. is only slowly moving towards compliance with the SNA standard.
3. Not shown is state and local government debt, which had a short burst in the 1950s, fell
back in the early 1980s, and then rose some in the late 1980s; 1995’s figure of 14.9% of
GDP is little different from 1962’s 14.0%.
4. This ignores self-employment income, part of which is a return to labor and part to
capital; it accounts for well under a tenth of personal income.
5. 1994 figures are used because the 1995 balance sheet figures were delayed by the
benchmark revisions of the national income accounts. Financial accounts were published for 1995, but data on tangible assets and capital stocks were unavailable as this
book was prepared for publication.
6. Note that in terms of credit market lending alone, households are net borrowers — but
households have many other kinds of assets, from houses to mutual funds, that don’t
show up as credit market assets. As a whole, the household sector has a highly positive
net worth.
7. The SCF is the most detailed and accurate survey of the financial state of the population
that exists, certainly for the U.S. and quite probably the world, but because of funding
shortages, it is done only every three years. Despite its detail and breadth — the interview on which it’s based is an hour long, involving reviews of actual financial records
and not just sums done from memory, and it catches far more rich people in its net than
routine Census surveys — it isn’t perfect. According to work by Edward Wolff (1994),
the SCF numbers don’t really match the FoF. People report their houses and privately
owned businesses to be worth almost a third more than the accountants estimate them
to be worth, which isn’t surprising, because the FoF figure is an estimate based on
historical investment figures, and people report current market prices (inflated, no doubt,
by an optimism premium). They understate their security holdings by half. People also
report lower debts to SCF surveyors than the FoF’s sums, meaning that SCF net worth is
substantially higher than FoF net worth estimates.
8. These figures are computed by dividing the annual dollar change in consumer credit
by the annual change in personal consumption expenditures.

sharp drop in income, as are those who ultimately file for bankruptcy — most probably because of job loss or medical emergency (Sullivan et al 1989, pp. 95–102, 185–
187). Credit seems again to be a private substitute for a civilized public welfare state.
One way of measuring the (in)equality of income or wealth distribution is with the Gini
index, which ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality, i.e., one person
has all the money). Gini indexes on wealth are astonishing. In 1989, the Census Bureau’s
household income Gini was .431; on the SCF, it was .505; for wealth, it was .793 overall,
and .966 excluding houses and cars (Weicher 1995).
The Fed has lately been doing its best to bury these numbers. Detailed reports on the
1983 Survey of Consumer Finances were published in its main journal, the Federal
Reserve Bulletin; only a very general report was published on the 1989 survey, and the
wealth distribution data was circulated only in the form of an unpublished working
paper, buried under 36 pages of technique. The Fed also sat on the wealth data for
month, delaying the release of the computer tapes until after the 1992 presidential
campaign election — for ostensibly technical reasons, but the official explanation must
be met with some skepticism. When the Democrats won, the forces interested in doing
the wealth arithmetic lost some of their zeal. The 1992 survey received similarly cursory treatment.
Who knows how underreporting affects this? It may be that despite the SCF’s best efforts, rich people are still falling through the net, or it may mean that nonrich people
are underreporting their holdings. The best one can do is say, if it’s good enough for
the Fed, it’s good enough for me.
The SCF’s catchall “nonwhite” is as misleading as it is callous. It includes Asians and
Hispanics, who are notably better off than blacks, and since their numbers are increasing faster than African Americans, they’re boosting the nonwhite average.
Other paths of influence — direct ones like takeover threats and shareholder rebellions, or indirect ones like stock prices and interest rates — are more important than
the regulation of market access, and will be taken up later.
The rationale for the formula is given in the graph’s caption.
When stock prices are high, one firm can take over another without spending cash, but
just by offering shares of its own stock as payment.
For different reasons, Post-Keynesian and Marxist economies object to making capital
into a factor of production on a par with labor, but those objections, as accurate as they
are, don’t really bear on the point being made here.
Later surveys lumped FIRE workers into “infrastructure, wholesale trade, and FIRE,”
mixing bus drivers in with bond traders.
Elsewhere, a source familiar with the New York gay S&M world said that most of the
Wall Streeters he’s met have been bottoms. As one explained to him, “The more
power I have, the greater my need to be humiliated.”
A building is thought to be worth x times its rent roll, with the x varying with interest
rates, the present state of the real estate market, investors’ general optimism or pessimism about the future, and various tax considerations. That x is the inverse of the
building’s yield. If interest rates are 5%, then a real estate investor might want annual
rental income to equal 10%, since real estate is riskier than a sound government or
corporate bond — so the building would be priced at ten times the rent roll. But real
estate is a game usually played with borrowed money, so the interest rate on that borrowed money would have to be subtracted from the rent to get the building’s net yield.
If the building appreciates over time, so much the better; rent can cover the mortgage,
with the price appreciation almost all gravy.
Insurance companies often manage pension fund assets, but in doing so they’re acting
more as portfolio managers than insurers in the narrow sense.

23. In April 1995, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Basel-based central
bankers club, proposed allowing banks to use their own internal computer models for
judging the riskiness of their exposure to derivatives and off-balance-sheet items, subject to the approval of national regulators. The BIS, normally a fairly conservative institution, is here showing great faith in both the models’ accuracy and the banks’ honesty
(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 1995).
24. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was said that a good deal of banking followed the 3-6-3 rule:
borrow money from your depositors at 3%, lend it to another set of customers at 6%,

26. The name “hedge fund” originally came from the fact that unlike most institutional

27. These were not entirely spontaneous formations: they were guided by upper-class reformers and philanthropists encouraging the moral development of the lower orders

years. The world’s first was Sweden’s Riksbank, founded in 1668; the Bank of England,
the world’s second, was founded (as a private banker to the government) in 1694.

33. An article in the Public Relations Journal (Shell 1990) said that “investor relations”
staffers — corporate PR specialists whose audience is Wall Street — shouldn’t “stonewall”; instead they should “provide ‘more’ information.” The use of quotes around
“more” — they’re in the original — suggests that the provision of more information
should never be confused with telling the truth.
34. One check on this confederacy of optimists are professional shorts — people who look
for companies with inflated reputations and stock prices, dig out the info, short the
stock, and then leak the bad news to reporters eager for a hot tip. If the news takes,
then the stock will suffer damage. Sometimes it doesn’t matter whether the bad news is
true; if the short can take a position and undertake a successful disinformation campaign, he or she can profitably cover the short.

+1 (perfect lockstep). A correlation coefficient under 0.2 marks a fairly cacophanous
relation, but figures over 0.9 signify great intimacy.
In fact, many foreign investments made in the U.S. during the 1980s have had
apparently dismal rates of return. The dollar’s decline has savaged financial
invesments, and real investments haven’t done much better. According to official U.S.
figures for 1993 (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis 1994),
foreigners earned a return of 1.4% (income divided by the total value of assets) on
their direct investments in the U.S., while U.S. firms earned 10.3% on their investments abroad. Japan ran in the red — a return of –2.4%. These figures are admittedly
only very rough approximations; it’s very hard to value the capital stock properly,
and companies scheme and cheat to reduce reported profits. But these numbers fit
well with anecdotal evidence that Japanese investors took a bath on their investments in the U.S. during the 1980s.
The agency that publishes the World Investment Reports was once known as the UN
Centre on Transnational Corporations (UNCTC). Though this was once a mildly subversive institution during the 1970s, when calls from the South for a new international
economic order were popular — meaning a more equitable distribution of global wealth
and power — the UNCTC grew tame along with everyone else by the 1980s. Still, the
Reagan and Bush administrations regarded the Centre as a nest of Bolsheviks, and
pressured the UN into reducing its status to the point where it is now a sub-speck
within UNCTAD, the UN Conference on Trade and Development. For the sake of consistency, I’m calling it the UNCTC anyway, even though the Centre no longer exists.
Again, it must be emphasized that the globalization of production shouldn’t be exaggerated. Most multinational firms make products in the country or region of their final
sale; the amount of shipment of parts and semifinished goods around the world is
nowhere near as great as is sometimes thought (Whichard and Lowe 1995).
Ironically, though born in London, Ricardo was of Dutch origin, and he was educated

Ensemble

Though it often seems like Wall Street inhabits a world entirely of its own
imaginative making, it is connected to the real world, in often indirect and
mysterious ways. So too the individual markets; though they often seem
to dance to their own music, what happens in one can affect another, or
sets of markets may simultaneously react to the same news. Having outlined the pieces, let’s now try to fit them together.
Mother Credit
If there is a mother of all financial markets it is the one for credit.1 Changes
in the terms on which some people let other people use their money move
both the financial markets and the real economy. When credit is easily
gotten, and when interest rates are low and/or falling, the financial markets typically sizzle; when credit is scarce, and rates are high and/or rising, financial markets do badly.
Why is this? Several reasons, the simple ones first. The focus here is on
stocks, which are typically the focus of speculators’ most ardent attentions, but the reasoning can be applied with only slight modifications to
other assets, like real estate, art, and even baseball cards.
• Cost of playing with other people’s money. Speculators — and in this
instance the word is used in a morally neutral sense to mean anyone
who buys a financial asset in the hope of selling it at a higher price in
the near or distant future — typically operate on borrowed money.
Any increase in the cost of funds increases their costs of doing business, with obvious effects on both their enthusiasm and buying power.
Someone who borrows money at 5% needs to make well over 5% to
justify the great risks of holding stocks or futures — say, just for the
118

ENSEMBLE

sake of argument, 10% or more. Should rates rise to 7%, the margin of
safety at a hoped-for 10% return would be reduced, meaning that a
return of 12% would be required. And returns of 12% are much rarer
than 10%, rare as those are. Consequently, speculative enthusiasm
dampens, and prices of speculative assets typically sag, when interest rates rise.
• Effects on sentiment. When interest rates rise or fall a nontrivial amount,
it’s usually with the consent or even the intention of the central bank.
When central banks lower rates, they’re trying to stimulate the real and
financial economies; when they raise rates, they’re trying to slow them
down. Sane speculators never bet against central banks, the center of
the entire financial universe: they create money, regulate credit, and
often decide whether troubled private banks will live or die. While not
almighty, central banks often get what they want, so they affect speculators’ sense of the future very powerfully. (Major central banks, that
is; the Fed and the Bundesbank are mighty, but the Bank of Mexico is
weak and the Bank of Zaïre little more than a joke.) Since financial
asset prices are built largely of expectations about the future, stimuli or
depressants to those expectations bear very directly on their prices.
Optimism boosts prices, and pessimism depresses them.
• Relative attractiveness of alternative investments. When interest rates
are low or falling, people despair of the earnings on their Treasury
bills, bank deposits, or money market funds; they search for juicier
profits, and plunge into stocks or long-term bonds, which typically
pay higher interest rates than short-term instruments. But when rates
are rising, the relative attractiveness of short-term investments rises. If
you can earn 7% on a CD, it may not be worth taking the extra risk of
holding stocks; but at 2% interest rates, stocks seem much less intimidating — irresistible even.
• Valuation. This is a bit more complicated: it depends on the future
value of money, one of the elementary concepts of financial analysis.
What is the value of $10,000 in 10 years? It’s the amount you’d have to
set aside today, at current interest rates, to have that $10,000 in 10 years.
If you were guaranteed to earn a 5% interest rate every year for the
next 10, you’d hit $10,000 if you made a bank deposit of $6,139, or
bought a bond of that value. That $6,139 would grow to $6,446 in a
year (the original amount plus 5% interest, $6,768 in the second
year…and so on, until year 10, when the $10,000 target would be hit.
In financial jargon, the present value (PV) of $10,000 at 5% over 10
119

WALL STREET

years is $6,139. But what would happen if interest rates were to rise to,
say, 10%? You’d need to set aside a lot less, because each year’s interest
earnings would be twice as high — and since you’d be earning interest
on interest, that effect is greatly magnified. At 10%, the PV of $10,000 in
10 years is $3,855, a lot less than the PV at 5%. This is illustrated graphically nearby.

shareholders out of those profits.2 In a normal world, those profits or dividends can be assumed to
grow with the economy every year. Some years, of course, will be better than others, but over time, it’s not unreasonable to assume that the
joys of ownership will grow by 5–10% a year. Take, for example, a
corporation that earns $10 in profits for every share of stock outstanding. Assume further that that amount will grow by 7.5% every year for
the next 20. What is its stock worth? In theory, its price should be some
function of the PV of that future stream of profits, discounted at prevailing interest rates. In this example, the stock that “earns” $10 today,
growing 7.5% a year to $39.51 at the end of 20 years, will throw off
$433.05 in profits over the 20-year period. At 5% interest rates, the PV
of that stream is $240.39; at 10%, $147.43. So even if the future prospects of a corporation remain unchanged, a rise or fall in interest rates
greatly changes the arithmetic used to value stocks. And if the change
in rates changes one’s estimates of future growth prospects — if, say,
higher interest rates lead the prospective stockholder to mark down
estimates of future profit growth, because of a less friendly economic
environment — then these simple arithmetic changes are magnified.
• Economic conditions. Stock prices rise when investors anticipate an
increase in profits and fall when they anticipate a decrease, and profits
move with the business cycle, rising in expansions and falling in contractions. I’ll have more to say about this in a bit, but on the matter of
immediate relevance, higher rates often portend a slump and lower
rates a recovery. Consequently, movements in interest rates color in120

ENSEMBLE

vestors’ estimation of the future course of profits.
With assets other than stocks, the economic environment counts
less directly. In a recession, speculators assume that other players will
be or at least feel less flush, making the prospects for unloading an
asset — whether it be a Rothko or 1,000 shares of Microsoft — at a
higher price less friendly. Words of caution are in order here too; no
one knows for sure when a recession will hit, so speculators may bet
that there will always be some “greater fool” to take a rare baseball
card off their hands, or that things are different this time and higher
rates won’t bring about a recession.
These are some of the reasons why interest rates have such a profound
impact on the prices of stocks and other speculative financial assets. Since
many of the same techniques used to value stocks are applied to realworld assets as well — like an ongoing business that may be up for sale,
or the willingness of a firm to undertake a new project or expand an existing one — rates are a powerful influence on real activity as well. And I
haven’t even mentioned the effects that changes in interest rates have on
the finances of both debtors and creditors.
finance and the economy
Changes in interest rates do affect the finances of households and business: rising interest rates will divert funds away from real spending and
towards debt service, while falling rates can deliver a windfall. One
shouldn’t make too much of this; in a strong expansion, rising employment, incomes, and profits will probably outweigh a modest increase in
interest rates, and in a deep slump, low rates can be only a weak antidote
to the general economic despair. To take two notorious historical examples,
microscopic T-bill rates of 0.28% in 1934 were not enough to end the Depression, and it took a sustained bout of 15–20% short-term rates in 1980
and 1981 to shut down the U.S. economy under the Volcker repression.
But in both cases, those were extraordinary times.
Instead, let’s look at the behavior of the major markets in more normal
times. Shown nearby are idealized — idealized by averaging, not by imagination — representations of the behavior of the stocks and interest rates
around business cycle peaks and troughs. Interest rates fall sharply as a
recession matures; because the average post-World War II recession has
lasted about nine months, you can say that short-term rates begin drop121

These charts show the behavior of interest rates and stock prices around business
cycle peaks and troughs, based on the average of nine U.S. business cycles between 1948 and 1995, with either the peak or trough month indexed to 100. “Bills”
are three-month U.S. Treasury bills; “bonds” are long-term U.S. Treasury bonds (maturity greater than 10 years); and “stocks” are the Standard & Poor’s 500 average, all
as reported by the Federal Reserve.

ping only a few months into a slump, with long rates acting a bit more
stickily. After a few months of declining rates — usually encouraged by
the Federal Reserve — the stock market begins reponding to one of its
favorite stimuli, lower rates. At business cycle peaks, the process is thrown
into reverse gear, with interest rates steadily rising and the stock market
flattening and finally sinking. Note that short-term rates move far more
dramatically in both directions than long-term rates; the yield curve normally flattens or even goes negative as the economy approaches recession, then turns steeply positive as the slowdown ends. In fact, the yield
curve “significantly outperforms other financial and macroeconomic indicators in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead” (Estrella and
Mishkin 1996) — and not only in the U.S., but in most of the rich industrial
countries (Bernard and Gerlach 1996). It outdoes the stock market and
composite leading indicators at this distance, with stocks and the composites having a forward vision of only about a single quarter.3
The bond market’s fear of economic strength, and its love of weakness,
used to be something of a Wall Street secret, at least until around 1993,
when it became a more open secret. Though it often shocks people when
they first hear about it, the reasoning isn’t that hard to follow. Creditors
hate inflation, since it erodes the value of their stock-in-trade, money itself. If the economy grows too fast and unemployment gets too low, then
inflation will almost inevitably rise. The real value of their bonds will deteriorate with the pickup in prices, and the interest rate agreed to in the days
122

ENSEMBLE

when inflation was lower will seem much less satisfying when the consumer price index is heading northwards.
There are several reasons for this. At the highest level of abstraction,
growth beyond the economy’s presumed capacity limits will strain human
and physical resources, resulting in an “overheating.” If left unchecked,
this will turn into a runaway boom, to be followed by a stunning collapse.
More concretely, if markets get too tight, then shortages and bottlenecks
will develop, resulting in price rises and order backlogs rather than healthy
growth. What is true of markets for goods and services is also true for
markets in human labor: if the pool of skilled workers runs dry, then wages
will rise, as employers bid for the scarce resource and workers feel their
power and turn more demanding. Consequently, when the economy looks
too strong, Wall Street demands that the Fed tighten in order to slow the
economy down to a crawl — and to push the unemployment rate significantly higher.
Many liberals and populists dismiss such reasoning as paranoid. Though
the history of actual economies shows that there’s no simple relationship
between growth and inflation, financiers are near-unanimous in their belief that a strong economy means rising prices, and is something to be
feared. And painful as it is to admit it, the financiers have a point — within
the limitations of the conventional worldview. While there may be no neat
mathematical trigger point when strength translates into inflation, tight
markets — whether measured by the percentage of total factory capacity
that’s in use, or the percentage of the workforce unemployed by the (inadequate and misleading) official measure, or the ratio of actual GDP to
its long-term trend growth rate — tend to lead to a higher inflation rate.
The reverse is also true, which is why the long and deep recession of the
early 1980s — much longer and deeper than policymakers had tolerated
in the 1970s — “broke the back” of inflation, as the cliché runs. It also
broke more than a few workers, but to Wall Street, that was mere collateral damage in a holy war for price stability.
Liberals and populists often search for potential allies among industrialists, reasoning that even if financial interests suffer in a boom, firms that
trade in real, rather than fictitious, products would thrive when growth is
strong. In general, industrialists are less than sympathetic to these arguments. Employers in any industry like slack in the labor market; it makes
for a pliant workforce, one unlikely to make demands or resist speedups.
If a sizeable portion of industry objected fundamentally to central bank
policy — not only in the U.S., but in the rest of the rich world — then
123

WALL STREET

central banks wouldn’t operate the way they do.4 While rentiers might
like a slightly higher unemployment rate than industrialists, the differences
aren’t big enough to inspire a big political fight.
Bond markets may hate economic strength, but what about stocks?
Street-level wisdom — Main Street, not Wall Street — usually holds that a
boom is good for stocks, but this isn’t the case. Most of the gains in a bull
market are made in the late recession–early recovery period. Stocks generally behave badly just as the real economy is at its strongest. Since the
early 1950s, reported investment advisor James Stack in the August 19,
1994, issue of his InvesTech newsletter, annual stock returns have averaged +20.1% when capacity utilization was below 82%, and +6.0% when it
was above; +16.9% when the Columbia University Center for International
Business Cycle Research’s leading index of inflation was below 0%, and
+8.3% when it was above; and +17.7% when the annual change in spot
raw materials prices was below 0%, and -0.7% when it was above. Other
work by Stack, inspired by Martin Zweig and reported in the April 28,
1995, issue of InvestTech, showed that conventional thinking, which sees
the best time to buy stocks as when corporate profits are soaring and the
worst time when they are collapsing, is exactly wrong. Between 1938 and
1994, Stack reported, excitedly, “the most profitable period to be invested
(with almost a 20% annualized return) was when the S&P 500’s fourquarter earnings were tumbling at over a -25% annual rate!” Next best was
during a profit decline of -10% to -25%, and so on, up to the worst period,
when profits were growing at over a 20% annual rate, when returns were
barely positive. Stocks thrive on a cool economy, and wither in a hot one.
That apparent contradiction may be resolved by timing: the stock market, following interest rates, tends to lead the real economy, as work by
Ahmad A. Kader (1985) shows — though Kader aptly points out that the
market’s leading role should not be confused with causation, since both
stocks and the real economy often respond similarly to the same stimuli
(notably, lower interest rates are typically manna to both worlds). Kader
reported that from 1963 to 1983, stock market changes were most highly
correlated with GNP growth two quarters later.
But that correlation is far from perfect. The market gave false signals in
1966 and 1976, dropping sharply with no subsequent recession. Kader
concludes that though the correlation is high, it is still “not as strong as
one might expect,” and should only be used “with caution” as a leading
economic indicator. The 1987 market crash had no economic effects —
but undoubtedly because of prompt, aggressive salvage operations
124

ENSEMBLE

launched by the world’s central banks; without those, the collapse would
probably have spread, 1929-style. The market must be seen as a somewhat unreliable narrator; it gets lost in its own stories as it tries to divine
the near future. And about the distant future, it thinks hardly at all.
Stepping into the wider world beyond the U.S. and beyond the merely
cyclical makes the picture even blurrier. John Mullin, an economist with
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, marshalled a sample of 13 countries, six of them industrialized and seven of them “developing” (Mullin
1993). Over the 15-year period from 1976 to 1991, Mullin’s data show that
long-term stock market performance can best be explained by dividend
growth — but even this is not the tightest of relations, since only 31% of
the variation in stock prices can be “explained” by variations in dividend
growth.5 On second glance, this statistical relation is even less satisfying
than it may seem; the equation delivered up by the regression suggests
that with an annual rate of 0% dividend growth, the average stock market
among the Mullin 13 would nonetheless go up by 16.6% a year. Stock
market investors are inveterate optimists. A less emotional explanation
might be that in a world where the rich tend to get richer, and park a lot of
their ever-expanding wealth in stocks, the market can rise despite a general economic torpor.
For the Mullin 13, the relationship between economic growth and stock
market performance is as good as random. Whether you use real GDP
figures in national currency, as reported in International Financial
Statistics, or U.S. dollar GDP per capita figures, as reported in the World
Bank’s World Tables, the relationship between stock performance and
economic growth is essentially patternless.6
Back to the U.S. economy, and more rigorous statistical work than either Stack’s, Kader’s, or mine. Nai-Fu Chen (1991), following up on some
earlier research (Chen, Roll, and Ross 1986), finds that stock returns can
be predicted by several indicators, notably the yield curve (the steeper the
curve, the better stocks and the economy will do over the next several
quarters); dividend yields (high relative to stock prices when the market is
poised to do well, and low when the market is likely to be weak); and
industrial production growth (which moves inversely to the market —
that is, the market does well when the economy doesn’t and vice versa).
These relations are mostly loose and noisy. It is interesting, though,
that Chen’s data shows that the real economy can also be thought of as
predicting the stock market (with real weakness portending financial
strength), turning the conventional notion of the stock market as the leader
125

WALL STREET

and the real world as the follower on its head. When things move in opposite directions, it’s admittedly hard to say which is the cause and which
is the effect.
allocation
A good deal of Wall Street time is devoted to asset allocation — figuring
out where to put money. Analysts are deployed, both on the buy (customer) and sell (broker) sides, to scrutinize the health of the national economies, industrial sectors, and classes of assets. Though lots of institutional
investors are restricted in what they can buy — managers of high-tech
mutual funds can’t buy auto stocks, and insurance companies don’t buy
penny stocks — even the most tightly specified have to figure out just
what to buy, sell, and hold. The less restricted have an array of choices to
make: financial assets vs. real commodities, domestic vs. foreign assets, if
foreign then Latin American vs. African, stocks vs. bonds, various kinds of
stocks (by industrial sector, by size of underlying company, by various
financial measures like price/earnings ratios) or bonds (government vs.
corporate, high-quality corporate vs. low-, long-term vs. short-), and so
on. Over the very long term stocks greatly outperform any other asset
class, but most people don’t care about the long term; they want to be in
today’s hot sector, the day after tomorrow be damned.
While stocks do outperform over the very long term, it’s not really clear
why; their performance can’t be explained by most conventional financial
models (Mehra and Prescott 1985; Siegel 1992). This is known as the equity premium puzzle in the trade. Many ingenious attempts have been
made to solve the puzzle — like “nonaddictive habit formation”
(Shrikhande 1996), whatever that means — but none have done so definitively. When measured against long-term economic growth — and Siegel’s
work covers the U.S. from 1802 through 1990, about as long-term as an
anlysis can get — stock returns seem too high and bond returns too low.
Of course, the underlying models may be nonsense, but if orthodox economics can’t explain the stock market, one of the central institutions of
modern capitalism, what can the discipline explain?
But no one on Wall Street cares about such fundamental questions.
Instead, the game is to play the cycle and the microcycle. Wall Street apologists might point to attempts to ride emerging long-term trends — biotech,
the Internet — with both great risk and promise, but the Street is often
wrong about these things; they’re far more passions of the moment than
126

ENSEMBLE

they are serious, detached prognostications. Talk of structural transformations is often just part of the sales rhetoric, a way to hawk a fresh asset
class or defend a favored old one. Few people pay as much attention to
the business cycle as Wall Streeters — understandable, given the chart
patterns around cyclical turning points. But understanding the cycle isn’t
enough; it’s also tempting to catch deviations from the cycle — “growth
recesssions,” “soft landings,” and the like. Great effort goes into predicting important numbers; meaningless factoids like “in four of the last five
Aprils, employment came in under the consensus” circulate, assertions
that are often wrong, but are nonetheless believed and solemnly repeated.
But if enough people believe them, and the market moves in accordance
with belief, what does it matter? Truth is what makes you money.
a trading week
Let’s take a look at a week’s trading in the financial markets to see how
they play against each other and the real world. I chose, part by chance
and part by design, the first week of May 1994. It was an interesting week
because several significant economic reports were due, notably the report on employment for April. In this instance, Wall Street was actually
interested in an important thing, since the state of the labor markets is,
aside from being the most humanly important of all the products of the
federal data mills, the best contemporaneous indicator of the general state
of the economy.
What follows was written in “real time” — which explains, and I hope
excuses, the use of the historical present — to capture the sentiments, as
ephemeral as they are, that moved the markets, and to avoid retrospective
wisdom. Traders, analysts, and some academics frequently argue that the
markets often dance to their own beat, and newsy explanations of their
choreography are simply after-the-fact rationalizations. Undoubtedly there’s
some truth to that, but for the moment this diary is offered in an agnostic
spirit. This is what happened, and how Wall Street represented itself to
itself and the outside world.7

the week
For some time now, analysts have been preoccupied with trying to divine
the strength and durability of the economic recovery that began formally
in March 1991, but which qualified as probably the weakest and most
tentative post-recession upswing in modern U.S. history.
127

WALL STREET

Wall Street has come to love this sluggishness — weak enough to keep
inflation at bay, but just strong enough to stifle political pressures for fiscal stimulus, and with job growth tepid enough to keep labor appropriately disciplined. Yet this spate of fair weather now seemed a pleasant but
fading memory. The real economy began picking up steam in late 1993,
to the alarm of the financial markets, and the monthly count of new jobs
was averaging around 200,000. If that pace of employment growth continued, the unemployment rate of 6.5%, stubbornly high for the third year
of an economic expansion, might decline. Though the job figures for January and February were depressed by unusually nasty winter weather, there
was a sharp rebound in March. Should April also show a brisk pace, then
all hell could break loose in the markets on Friday.
The language used to describe this economic strengthening would seem
surreal to one untrained in the subtle wisdom of Wall Street. Phrases like
“dark clouds” and “threat overhanging the market” have been thrown
around for the last six months or so to describe a situtation that might
seem like good news to the outside world. Wall Street has become convinced that GDP growth over 2.5–3.0% and unemployment rates below
6.5% are now “unsustainably strong,” and must be reined in by tighter
Federal Reserve policies.
After nearly four years of falling interest rates, the Fed began reversing
the trend in early 1994. As of this week, the central bank had tightened
policy in three notches, starting on February 4, and was expected to continue to do so over the next several months. With that tightening came the
first signs of serious troubles in the U.S. financial markets — and the world’s
— since Iraq’s hostile takeover of Kuwait in 1990. Markets thrive on lower
interest rates and swoon on higher ones. Bond prices have fallen about
20% from their 1993 peaks, and stock prices about 10%. Everyone’s favorite “emerging market,” Mexico, has also sold off sharply, becoming a “submerging market,” and the whole “miracle” — or “bubble,” if you prefer
— seems on the verge of coming unstuck. The recent declines were fairly
widespread; a Salomon Brothers report released early in the week showed
that of all the world’s major bond markets, only Japan’s showed gains in
price (and declines in yield) during April.
These early cracks were showing in financial markets that were among
the most overvalued in history. Though the U.S. stock market, and most
other world markets, experienced a massive crash in 1987, and a minicrash in 1989, they hadn’t experienced a sustained bear market like the
one of the mid-1970s in 20 years. But despite those cracks, the general
128

ENSEMBLE

mood was one of confidence; while the markets might stumble, most players were convinced that the unpleasantness would be no more than transitory. As the brokerage house Wheat First said in a commentary reported
on CNBC, the markets were experiencing no more than “an infrequent
period of extraneous volatility.”
Monday, May 2, 1994. At 10 AM, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) released its April survey of the executives who buy
things for large corporations. Instead of falling slightly, it rose slightly.
The NAPM index has become one of Wall Street’s current faves, since it’s
supposed to be a good guide to the state of the manufacturing economy,
and one that comes out more

the world’s fourth-largest drug company. Syntex, once a high-flying stock,
had crashed recently because many of its most important patents had been
expiring, and it had nothing in its R&D pipeline to match the old hits.
Other drug stocks rose in sympathy with Syntex’s; since health reform
and cost-containment pressures had been pressing the consolidation of
the industry, it didn’t seem outlandish to bet on the possibility of other
mergers. And even if they didn’t happen, well, it was today’s story. Who
knows what tomorrow’s will be?
Tuesday. At 8:30 AM, the Commerce Department reported that its index
of leading economic indicators (LEI), so-called not because of their promi129

WALL STREET

nence but because of their tendency to lead changes in the real economy
by 6 to 9 months, rose 0.7% in March, and the reading for February was
revised from down 0.1% to unchanged.8 Both were a hair above expectations. The message is that the economy survived the winter and is bouncing back strongly in the spring. Since this message is now quite familiar,
and since the numbers came in more or less in line with expectations, and
since most of the components of the index are known in advance of the
formal announcement, the markets shrugged off the news, and some began speculating about next month’s number.
The U.S. dollar was weak on the foreign exchange markets, continuing
a multiweek slide that defies short-term economic logic. European interest rates have been tending lower, thanks to the grudging easing by the
German Bundesbank, and U.S. rates tending higher, developments that
should argue for a higher dollar (developments that should attract capital
to the U.S., thereby pushing up the currency). The only immediate rationale was political — the Clinton administration would like to see a higher
value for the yen to press Japan into making trade concessions. But that
doesn’t explain why the dollar should fall against European currencies. A
longer-term explanation — that the U.S. is a debtor country whose export
industries are addicted to the stimulus of a cheap currency — is attractive,
but the timing is a bit hard to explain.
Though the Fed and other central banks came to the dollar’s defense
late last week, it could be that currency speculators found the interventions half-hearted, and they might be testing the authorities’ resolve. If
central banks defend a sickly currency with only half measures, then these
defenses can be little more than a gift to traders.9 In this example, the
central banks bought dollars with marks and yen to prop up the U.S. unit’s
value. But from the traders’ point of view, the central bankers were just
buying a depreciating asset with appreciating ones without having any
lasting effect on the market’s trend. A casino operator who played by these
rules would quickly be out of business.
Bond prices were depressed by the weak dollar, because, should intervention fail, the Fed will be forced to hike interest rates even more than
they want to otherwise, and more than the markets had been expecting.
Stocks, despite the weakness in bonds, staggered indecisively, with
broader indexes down modestly and the blue-chip Dow up, led higher by
Eastman Kodak, which announced that it would spin off its Sterling drug
division. Stock jockeys endorsed the move as evidence that Kodak would
now be free to focus on its core businesses; only a few years ago, the
130

ENSEMBLE

acquisition of Sterling was cheered as a diversification away from its stodgy
old film business, widely thought to be a technology in decline in these
days of electronic imaging. In other merger news, the software firms
Broderbund and Electronic Arts called off their marriage, saying that the
market’s negative judgment, expressed in declining share prices since the
announcement, made the union look unwise. Thus do market gyrations
affect the real world.
Wednesday. The New York morning brought news of heavy central bank
intervention to prop up the sagging U.S. dollar, which reached sevenmonth lows in yesterday’s trading. In a statement to the press, Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who is in charge of the dollar — currency market
intervention is the only instance where the Fed is legally required to defer
to executive branch wishes — said that the administration “sees no advantage to an undervalued currency,” and that the intervention was designed to counter “recent moves in exchange markets [that] have gone
beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals.” By day’s end, the
central banks of 17 countries bought $3–5 billion to prop up the currency’s
value — the most massive currency operations in a decade — with the
Fed alone intervening 17 times. But in a market where trading averages
around $1 trillion a day, it’s unlikely that intervention alone will reverse
the trend; should the greenback resume its slide after the smoke clears,
then the Fed might be forced to raise interest rates if it really wants to
defend the dollar’s value. The U.S. bond market’s weakness in the face of
the intervention led to market gossip that a Fed tightening — specifically,
an increase in the discount rate — was imminent.
Foreign exchange traders suspect that the Clinton adminstration would
be happy to see the dollar fall some more, suspicions that were reinforced
by Labor Secretary Robert Reich’s remark that the dollar’s swoon wasn’t
inflationary, because “currency valuations are relatively short-term phenomena.” The Labor Department quickly issued a “clarification” of Reich’s
remark, saying that it was not intended as a comment on exchange rate
policy. As the week progressed, adminstration officials refused to utter a
word about the dollar, robotically saying that only Bentsen was authorized to make such statements. Even after the intervention, suspicions lingered that Clinton & Co. would be happy to see the dollar decline some
more — just not too quickly, and as long as it didn’t threaten the stability
of U.S. financial markets.
At noon, the Fed released its “beige book” — or “tan book,” depending
131

WALL STREET

on your preferences — a compilation of reports about economic conditions around the country issued every six weeks in advance of the policysetting Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) meeting. (The name
comes from the fact that the copy presented to FOMC members has a
beige cover; market participants see mainly wire service accounts of the
volume, and the version mailed to mere civilians has only a white paper
cover and very low production values.) The report is based on work at the
twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, each of which has a formidable
intelligence network in its district, based on interviews with executives,
bankers, real estate developers, tax collectors, and other inhabitants of
what financial players call the “real sector.”
For years, beige books have been reporting tepid economic conditions,
with regional or sectoral pockets of strength amidst a fairly tentative recovery. This issue, however, reported “solid” growth everywhere but California, and even the first signs of a pickup there. Several important sectors
— autos, steel, and building materials — were said to be “near capacity.”
In Fedcode, this means that bottlenecks and price rises are probably not
far behind, conditions which must be addressed through another tightening. Since the economy’s growth was described as “solid,” this must be
taken as evidence that the Fed thinks the tightening can be done without
much damage. That the at-capacity sectors are very interest-rate sensitive
— the strength of the auto and housing markets correlates strongly with
the expense or cheapness of auto and mortgage loans — no doubt reinforces Fed resolve to tighten, if not now, than at the May FOMC meeting.
In the stock market, drug and other health care stocks remained hot,
thanks to the spillover from the Syntex and Sterling news, and to continued buzz that industry consolidation was inevitable.
Thursday. Markets were fairly quiet today, as the dust settled in the forex
markets, and stock and bond players awaited tomorrow’s employment
report. At 8:30, the BLS reported a drop in the number of workers applying for unemployment insurance last week; this was taken as a sign that
tomorrow’s employment report would be on the strong side. For some
reason, Wall Street takes this so-called initial claims series as a picture of
the present employment picture; in reality, it’s a better predictor of the
near future, which is why it’s one of the components of the official leading
indicators index.
Entertainment was provided by Democrats on the housing subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, which offered a forum for
132

ENSEMBLE

homebuilders to complain about the Fed’s growing stinginess. An industry lobbyist estimated that higher rates have already trimmed construction
payrolls by 80,000 jobs, and another 100,000 were at risk were the rises
not to be reversed. Senator Paul Sarbanes, the subcommitee chair, said he
was “puzzled” and “deeply concerned” by the Fed’s tightening, which is
fairly hard to believe, since Sarbanes isn’t stupid by Senatorial standards
and the Fed’s behavior is perfectly consistent with what it and Wall Street
see as its mission — keeping the economy slack enough to prevent inflationary pressures from developing. Congressional posturing, some of it
sincere, is little more than steam-venting, since no respectable legislator
would ever seriously challenge the primacy of money capital; in fact, politicians are often happy to have the Fed take the heat for them.
Stocks, bonds, and other major asset markets closed nearly unchanged,
as they often do ahead of important news; only the bravest make big bets
16 hours before an announcement that may prove their guesses very wrong.
The only exception was the Dow Jones Utility Average, which sagged,
suggesting underlying weakness in confidence and an upward bias to interest rates lurking behind the apparent calm.
Friday. According to a survey taken a week ago by MMS International, a
research boutique, the market’s average expectations are that the U.S.
economy added 175,000 jobs in April, or more precisely, that the Bureau
of Labor Statistics will report that as the estimate of the month’s job growth.
While the BLS’s monthly survey of employers is “the largest monthly sampling operation in the field of social statistics,” as the Bureau’s boilerplate
in every issue of Employment and Earnings reads, it is still only an estimate, and is subject to numerous revisions, as are most economic numbers. Still, what really matters for the markets is the number that prints on
the news ticker an eyeblink after the report is released; serious analysts
may scrutinize the release for clues to the truth behind the headlines, but
if you’re slinging paper around, what matters more than anything else is
whether a number comes in meaningfully above or below the consensus.
For the working class, April turned out to be a better month than Wall
Street imagined: employment grew by 267,000, and the previous two
months’ estimates were revised up fairly sharply. (Connoisseurs sometimes view revisions as a clue to an underlying trend; upward revisions
suggest a strong underlying trend, and one that official numbers may be
underestimating; downward revisions suggest the reverse. Not that there’s
any serious evidence this is the case, though.) Bond prices instantly fell
133

WALL STREET

over a full point, a moderately dramatic move, ignoring news elsewhere
in the statistical release showing that average hourly earnings grew only
three cents, to $11.06 — an annual rate of just over 3%, in line with inflation. For U.S. workers, who’ve experienced 20 years of declining real hourly
wages, even this strong employment growth has been unable to deliver
any wage improvement. To Wall Street eyes, however, that’s good news:
“wage inflation” is under control for now. There’s nothing the bond ghouls
hate more than real wage increases for anyone but themselves.
Despite that wage sluggishness, and the good behavior of the general
price indexes, the consensus is that the Fed will tighten again before long.
This supposition was confirmed by Fed governor Lawrence Lindsey, who
said that monetary policy was “not quite in neutral.” Neutral, in Fedspeak,
is a euphemism for moderately tight; for months the central bank’s line
has been that its low interest rate policies, which had saved the financial
system from the indiscretions of the 1980s, were excessively stimulative
now that the financial system had healed, and that it was merely shifting
policy back to “neutral” by pushing up rates.
Weekend. The lead headline in Sunday’s New York Times declares “U.S.
Shifts Stance In Effort To Slow Economic Growth,” and its first sentence
reads: “After a year and a half of seeking faster economic growth, the
Clinton Administration has now reluctantly changed course, putting the
stability of financial markets ahead of rapid economic expansion.” Deeper
into the story, the author Keith Bradsher notes that this shift “could be
unpopular with liberal Democrats…[b]ut it is in keeping with Mr. Clinton’s
political goal of positioning himself as a Democrat who is not feared on
Wall Street.” Growth must be throttled back to no more than 2.5%, or maybe
3% tops — below levels that might make possible sharper reductions in
unemployment, strengthen labor’s bargaining position, and maybe even
reverse, however temporarily, the 20-year decline in real wages.
This story may be a plant, an attempt to calm the markets through leaking; Bradsher is a reporter who has had no trouble serving as a frictionless
conduit for administration or Fed propaganda. But it does fit with events;
challenging the Wall Street demand for slower growth would be political
dynamite — just the kind of fight a not-feared-on-Wall-Street Democrat
would shy away from. The bond-market vigilantes have won.
Postscript. This book is being prepared for publication two-and-a-half years
after that diary was written. Growth continued to be strong for the rest of
134

ENSEMBLE

1994, consistently surprising Wall Street, which was touting an imminent
slowdown, and the Fed tightened several more times. 1994 turned out to
be the bond market’s worst year in modern history, and perhaps ever;
higher U.S. interest rates helped throw Mexico into crisis. For a moment, it
looked like a bear market and maybe even a recession was in order, but
the Fed, apparently fearing that it had overdone the tightening, backed off
a bit, pushing down fed funds from their spring 1995 peak. Growth slowed
considerably — whether because of the Fed’s tightening, tight fiscal policy,
or the economy’s immanent torpor — to the 2.0–2.5% range, below the
targets mentioned in Bradsher’s Times article, but still above recession
levels. Despite the slow growth, the labor market tightened over the next
two years, with unemployment falling by a percentage point. The dollar
continued its decline into the summer of 1995, stabilized, and then regained about half its losses by mid-1996. The bond market retraced a bit
more than half its decline, and the stock market, already grandly overvalued, rose 46% over the next two years. Though presumably Fed tightening would be in order someday, 1995 and 1996 were wonderful years to
own stocks.

1. The allusion is not only to Saddam Hussein, but to Karl Marx (1981, p. 596): “[I]nterestbearing capital always being the mother of every insane form, so that debts, for example, can appear as commodities in the mind of the banker….”
2. Dividends are generally more stable than profits, but depend ultimately on them, so for
the purposes of this exercise, they are pretty well interchangeable. Academics prefer
looking at dividends, and Wall Streeters, profits.
3. This weak predictive value of the stock market was confirmed in a study of banks that
failed or weakened in the 1980s. Katerina Simons and Stephen Cross (1991) found that
stock prices “fail[ed] to anticipate bank downgrades by examiners.” Stock traders learned
when everyone else did that a bank was in trouble. Despite this record, Wall Street folk
wisdom attributes almost mystical fortune-telling power to financial markets; some
partisans even argue that agricultural futures markets are better at forecasting the weather
than meteorologists.
4. There is the additional fact that many nonfinancial corporations have heavy financial
interests; GE, an ideal type of the large U.S.-based industrial enterprise, derived 24% of
its 1994 profits from financial services (S&P Online).
5. That is, in a linear regression of stock market return on dividend growth, the adjusted
r2 is .31, with p=.0282. Firms tend to smooth dividend payouts over the economic cycle
(that is, dividends are less volatile than profits or economic growth), so some of this
correlation may be spurious. Thanks to Mullin for sharing the data behind his article.

8. This index, along with the lagging and coincident indicators, was privatized in 1996;
the Commerce Department turned over its production and publication to the businessfunded Conference Board. Since the indexes are compiled from previously reported
data, almost all of it from the government, the Department deemed it a low-priority
item in the face of stiff budget cuts. Still, the indexes and their components are useful,
and until late 1995 were published in the “yellow pages” of the Department’s flagship
economic journal, Survey of Current Business. These pages were a residue of another
casualty of budget constraint, the Business Conditions Digest, snuffed in 1990; the BCD’s
yellow pages were folded into the Survey. (The BCD was origianlly known as the
Business Cycle Digest, but in the optimistic days of the late 1960s, when it was thought
the business cycle had been conquered by adept Keynesian management, the Cycle
was changed to Conditions.) They join in death the Survey’s “blue pages,” another
compendium of useful indicators, snuffed in 1994. No doubt, the Conference Board
will do a fine job in assembling and distributing the indicators. But they apparently feel
no sense of public duty in pricing their new service, Business Cycle Indicators; a year
will go for $95 and up. A subscription to the Survey of Current Business, however, was
$41 in 1996, and the journal also contains huge amounts of original information.
9. Though intervention is far from the suicidal thing it’s thought to be for the central
banks, as we saw in Chapter 1. In this case, the U.S. dollar continued to sink, with the
Fed’s dollar index losing about 5% of its value through the end of 1994, and about that
much again in 1995. Still, the central bank made $706 million in profits on foreign
exchange intervention in all of 1994.

Market models

So far, this has largely been a Wall Street vulgate. What has the dismal
science done with finance on a more rigorous level?
In (neo)classical economics, money is held to be neutral — a mere lubricant to trade, but not a force in itself. Ironically, though, theories from
that tradition were part of the intellectual foundation as well as the marketing garb for the financial experiments of the 1980s.
The place of finance — lumping together money and credit in disregard of all distinctions between them1 — in economics is quite odd. As
Claudio Borio (1995, p. 3), an economist with the Bank for International
Settlements, put it:
It seems fair to say that central bankers, accustomed to tracing the effects of
their actions through the financial system, have probably laid more emphasis on credit than academics, who are more used to thinking in terms of
simple paradigms where credit may not even appear explicitly. Similarly,
credit has traditionally been more prominent in policy discussions in several continental European countries than in some Anglo-Saxon ones, especially in the United States, partly because of a less pervasive monetarist
tradition….

Borio is right that central bankers, and economists working for central
banks, are often much more interesting than academics on the subject of
how finance and the concrete relate to each other. His “simple paradigms”
are the neat mathematical models that economists build to represent social reality, or at least to convey some theory about social reality, paradigms that often ignore money and finance completely, or treat it as an
afterthought. (The irony of “monetarism” being partly responsible for this
strange indifference to money and credit is one I’ll return to.) Those American economists who haven’t ignored finance have built their own para137

WALL STREET

digms, simple and complex, that return the favor by often treating the
“real” sector as an afterthought.
A web of financial theories, spun from the 1950s onward, became the
orthodoxy of business schools and editorial boards in the 1970s onward.
These theories held that the markets are efficient and rational, that they
optimize the allocation of social capital, and that the capital structure of
firms (how much debt and how much equity are on the balance sheet)
hardly matters. Finance became capital’s master control panel; liberated
from the fetters of regulation, it could spontaneously drain capital from
declining sectors and flood more promising ones with cash — without
introducing any mischief of its own. To argue this, economists and professors of finance built many lovely models.2
the technique of economics
Charles Plosser (1984) listed some of the basic assumptions on which modern financial theory is based:
Most of the fundamental contributions to financial economics, including
portfolio theory, the Modigliani–Miller Theorem, efficient markets, and virtually all of the asset-pricing models, have been developed under the assumption of a perfect market by which I mean (1) no transaction costs, (2)
complete and costless information, and (3) competition.

As Plosser noted, “theorists, especially of the Keynesian variety, are quick
to assume the existence of arbitrary constraints and/or market failures,”
such as “institutional and/or wage–price rigidities, nonmarket clearing,
exogenously determined long-term contracts, and the money illusion, to
which you may add your favorites.” But, argued Plosser, we need pure
models of market function so we may better understand the departures
from purity. In economics, reality is often treated not as the starting point
of analysis, but as a set of unfortunate constraints on or exceptions to the
theoretical utopia of perfect markets.
If you read neoclassical — or what used to be called bourgeois — economics, the market performs its magic for free. Prices float gently to their
natural level, goods and capital are led magnetically to their most fruitful
roles, and material production and human happiness are thereby maximized. But markets are expensive to create and maintain, and even if the
“adjustments” promoted by free-flowing markets were efficient, there’s
no guarantee the efficiency gains exceed the costs of the market. The con138

MARKET MODELS

sumer sphere, for example, is powered by a massive regime of psychometricians and image merchants. And finance, as was shown in Chapter
2, is very expensive. Information gathering is hardly costless; both consumers and industrialists spend plenty of time and money researching the
stuff they buy. Nor are all participants equally informed; what small shareholder could undertake the research a huge investment fund can, or eavesdrop on the secrets that leak through Chinese walls?
A nonacademic confronting the academic economics literature is confronted with a largely terrible thing. Much of it consists of building elaborate models, and empirical work consists in fitting data to the model.3
Financial theory is one of the most mathematized branches of economics.
Economics was once known as political economy; class, power, institutions, and even a vision of how the world should be mattered at least as
much as numbers. Politics began to disappear in the 19th century, and
mathematics came to dominate in the mid-20th. Economics, at least in the
English-speaking world, has become more and more a matter of econometrics. As Peter Kennedy (1987, p. 1) noted in his excellent primer on
the subject, “strange as it may seem,” there is no generally accepted definition of econometrics. Kennedy said his guide to econometrics was devoted to “the development of statistical techniques appropriate to the
empirical problems characterizing the science of economics.” Kennedy
used the word “science” without any quotation marks.
As one of the field’s major adepts, Gerard Debreu (1991) noted in his
1990 presidential address to the American Economic Association (AEA),
in 1940, one only needed basic college math to follow the trade; in 1990,
“graduate training in mathematics is necessary.” To Debreu, the field has
been “helped by greater abstraction,” though details on the nature of this
claimed improvement are sparse in his text. But Debreu does concede
one problem with this numerical turn — that it has promoted an insularity
in the profession, so that mathematical sophistication itself, regardless of
its referent, is rewarded, and so that its very incompehensibility to a general audience is part of the thrill. “Since its messages cannot be deciphered
by economists who do not have the proper key, their evaluation is entrusted to those who have access to the code.” And so economics has
walled itself off from the other social sciences, intoxicated by fantasies of
its own rigor.
Economic numbers are dirty statistics — not because of deviousness or
incompetence on the part of the data gatherers, but by the very nature of
the animal. National income accounting is carried out to the nearest hun139

WALL STREET

dred million dollars, but the figures are only estimates, imperfectly collected and imperfectly organized. GDP estimates can never be as accurate
as blood counts. Run two or three time series, estimates all, through your
statistical software and you may either compound errors or fall prey to
spurious correlations. Investment is hard enough to measure (is software
capital?), and depreciation is even harder, but these estimates in turn form
the basis of measuring growth, profitability, and productivity. Income and
production figures are often extrapolated from employment estimates, so
any link discovered between can be less than revealing. Econometricians
use ever more sophisticated techniques to try to outwit the deficiencies in
their data, but all fall prey to Goodheart’s Law, “namely that all econometric models break down when used for policy” (Kennedy 1987, p. 6).
Though the machinery has gotten considerably more complicated over
the years, econometricians essentially compare two or more variables with
each other to find some pattern among them — or to find it missing, if
they’re trying to disprove something. An analyst might devise a model in
which changes in money growth, interest rates, private investment, and
government spending were tested separately and together for their capacity to anticipate changes in GDP growth. In such a model, GDP would
be the dependent, and the others the independent, variables. Kennedy
(1987, p. 69) offered this advice on how to choose the variables for your
model:
The first and most important ingredient in such a search is economic theory.
If economic theory cannot defend the use of a variable as an explanatory
variable, it should not be included in the set of potential independent variables. Such theorizing should take place before any empirical testing of the
appropriateness of potential independent variables; this guards against the
adoption of an independent variable just because it happens to “explain” a
significant portion of the variation in the dependent variable in the particular sample at hand.

This takes hypothesis testing — hypotheses presumably being derived
from the informed observation of reality — into a purely ideal realm. Observation and experience are distrusted, and theory instead is the lodestar. Given the bias of most theorists and theories, then, this style of
economics can generally be trusted to produce results proving unfettered
markets to be the finest principle of social organization.
There’s one sterling example of that dependable bias, the minimum
wage, almost universally regarded by economists to be a job-killer. Their
140

MARKET MODELS

reasoning is pure Econ 101 — raise the price of something (and a wage is
the price of labor), and you depress demand for it. Therefore, boosting
the minimum wage has to result in an employment decline for low-end
workers. But in surveys of employers taken just before and after changes
in the minimum wage, David Card and Alan Krueger (1995) showed that
this just isn’t true. They paused for a few pages in the middle of their
book, Myth and Measurement, to review some reasons why the academic
literature has almost unanimously found the minimum wage guilty as
charged. They surmised that earlier studies showing that higher wages
reduced employment were the result of “publication bias” among journal
editors. They also surmised, very diplomatically, that economists have been
aware of this bias, and played those notorious scholarly games, “specification searching and data mining” — bending the numbers to obtain the
desired result. They also noted that some of the early studies were based
on seriously flawed data, but since the results were desirable from both
the political and professional points of view, they went undiscovered for
several years.
In its forecasting, math-happy economics exposes its limits to the world,
proving Wassily Leontief (1971) too kind in his remark that “in no other
field of empirical inquiry has so massive and sophisticated a statistical
machinery been used with such indifferent results.” Two examples of selfcriticism come to mind. In a review of the forecasting accuracy of the
IMF’s World Economic Outlook and that of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, Fund staff economist M.J. Artis (1988)
found them roughly comparable, with a decent record if you go no further than one year out, but likely to miss turning points. In other words, if
next year is pretty much like this year, the forecast will be accurate.
Economists from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (Fullerton 1992,
Saunders 1992, Rosenthal 1992) reviewed the Bureau’s own employment
projections and found similar failings. The 1973 forecast for 1990 greatly
underestimated the continuing surge of women into the workforce. Projections of the female labor force participation rate (LFPR) in 1990 made
in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1985 were a lot closer to the mark, but by 1978,
women’s LFPR had already risen sharply enough to be noticeable. In its
macroeconomic projections, the 1978 and 1981 GNP forecasts for 1990
were too optimistic — the 1978 forecast by a margin of 11.5%, a not inconsiderable $386 billion. Though the error got smaller as time went on, there
was a persistent tendency to overestimate the growth of labor productivity. Forecasts for the composition of GNP were even worse than the ag141

WALL STREET

gregate numbers: the consumption share projected for 1990 in 1978 was
too high; that predicted in 1981 was too low; 1983 and 1985 projections
were much closer to the market — but all missed the fall in spending on
nondurable goods and the rise in spending on medical and financial services. The BLS also missed deindustrialization and the overbuilding of
commercial real estate — trends that unhappily shaped the U.S.
macroeconomy of the early 1990s. In the words of the Bureau’s own summary of its review, “the projections improve the nearer to the target year
they are made…; the downside is that they often fail to forsee major structural shifts in the U.S. economy” (Saunders 1992, p. 15). In other words,
forecasts are least accurate when they are most needed — when the world
is about to change. They are best at predicting the present and the near
future, assuming the status quo isn’t overturned.
The point of this little review is not just to embarrass official wisdom,
though certainly that is always fun, but to undermine confidence in the
entire enterprise of conventional mathematized economics. And few subfields are as math-dense as finance. A lot of neat theories grew up in the
1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, only to be challenged by some neater theories in
the 1980s and 1990s, but the entire project of clever, influential, and largely
empty theorizing about capital markets and the invisible hand has yet to
be severely questioned. Even the extensive empirical work by a number
of financial economists, often based on thousands, even millions, of data
points, fails to provide any significant enlightenment, because it asks such
self-contained, even puerile, questions.4
As Leontief argued — in the presidential address to the AEA given 20
years before Debreu’s — that self-contained quality is a significant reason
for the failings of econometric analysis.
The same well-known sets of figures are used again and again in all possible
combinations to pit different theoretical models against each other in formal
statistical combat. For obvious reasons a decision is reached in most cases
not by a knock-out, but by a few points. The orderly and systematic nature
of the entire procedure generates a feeling of comfortable self-sufficiency.5

Real progress, he continued, would require crossing disciplinary boundaries — towards engineering (or, he might have added, industrial organization) to understand the process of production, or anthropology and
demographics (or psychology) to understand consumption. But in the hermetic world of conventional analysis, prices are explained with regard to
other prices, output with regard to other outputs, and so on — a circular,
142

MARKET MODELS

almost onanistic process of analysis. The interesting stuff — OPEC’s rise
in the 1970s, for example, and its fall in the 1980s — is typically relegated
to the realm of “exogenous shocks.” Some theories of the business cycle
explain recessions as purely exogenous phenomena — an intellectual convenience, since it allows the theorist to avoid the labor of explaining booms
and busts, and an ideological one as well, since it exonerates market processes themselves as the source of instability.
Studying economics also seems to make you a nastier person. Psychological studies have shown that economics graduate students are more
likely to “free ride” — shirk contributions to an experimental “public goods”
account in the pursuit of higher private returns — than the general public.
Economists also are less generous than other academics in charitable giving. Undergraduate economics majors are more likely to defect in the classic
prisoner’s dilemma game than are other majors.6 And on other tests, students grow less honest — expressing less of a tendency, for example, to
return found money — after studying economics, but not after studying a
control subject like astronomy (Frank, Gilovich, and Regan 1993).
This is no surprise, really. Mainstream economics is built entirely on a
notion of self-interested individuals, rational self-maximizers who can order their wants and spend accordingly. There’s little room for sentiment,
uncertainty, selflessness, and social institutions. Whether this is an accurate picture of the average human is open to question, but there’s no question that capitalism as a system and economics as a discipline both reward
people who conform to the model.7
After this overture, let’s examine three of the most prominent theories
that financial economists developed over the years — Tobin’s q, the
Modigliani–Miller theorem, and the efficient market hypothesis. The first
is a theory of how finance influences the real world; the second, a vision
of how finance is largely irrelevant to the real world; and the third, a deeply
influential story about how markets are wondrous instruments of adjustment and allocation. Like all models, they tried to simplify the world in
order to explain it. All are wrong.
A footnote: high finance theory is often associated with the political
right (the University of Chicago being virtually synonymous with both).
But Modigliani and especially Tobin are among the most “liberal” of the
mainstream economists. Like American foreign policy, modeling markets
is a bipartisan affair.
In fairness to Tobin, though, he is critical of the financial system. He
famously mourned the proclivity of his Yale students to head towards Wall
143

WALL STREET

Street, to waste human and financial resources on “financial activities remote from the production of goods and services…activities that generate
high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity” (Tobin
1984). He stood out among his peers in a Twentieth Century Fund (1992,
p. 23) report on “market speculation and corporate governance” for recommending a securities transaction tax. So far right has the center moved
that this old-style Keynesian looks like a rebel.
Tobin’s q
James Tobin and William Brainard followed up on a few sentences from
Keynes’s General Theory to create a theory of how the financial markets
regulate investment. Keynes (1936/1964, p. 151) said:
[The] daily revaluations of the Stock Exchange, though they are primarily
made to facilitate transfers of old investments between one individual and
another, inevitably assert a decisive influence on the rate of current investment. For there is no sense in building up a new enterprise at a cost greater
than that at which a similar existing asset can be purchased; whilst there is
an inducement to spend on a new project what may seem an extravagant
sum, if it can be floated off on the Stock Exchange at an immediate profit.

Being modern economists, Tobin and Brainard (1977) wanted to translate Keynes’s prose into numbers, replacing his “common sense” with scientific rigor. In their model, firms invest more if the market values them
highly, and hold back if they are assigned a lowly value. Keynes spoke
only of the stock market, but Tobin and Brainard added debt. Specifically,
they defined q as the market value of a firm’s shares and long-term debt
divided by the value of its real capital. When q is above 1, firms should
invest, because the market will mark up their value by more than the investment. When it’s below 1, firms will see their market value — mainly
their stock price, since debt prices fluctuate far less — rise by less than the
value of investment. Good managers should follow these signals.
Tobin, writing with and without Brainard, has claimed that changes in
q are an important way for a central bank to manipulate the real economy.
When interest rates are forced down by the Fed, stock and bond prices
usually rally; when tightness reins, security prices generally sink. Higher
markets will then induce real corporate investment. Similar reasoning has
been applied to households, with changes in the value of financial assets
stimulating or stifling the lust for houses, cars, and gadgets.
144

MARKET MODELS

Most central bankers agree that changes in asset prices — not only
stocks, but also bonds and real estate — have some influence on personal
and business spending. But as the BIS economist J.T. Kneeshaw (1995, p.
3) conceded, the mechanisms are still “not well understood,” despite a
century of experience with modern central banking. The deregulation and
financial innovation of the last 20 years have made things even murkier.
In the U.S., the Fed assumes that half the impact of monetary policy on
the real economy occurs through effects on household balance sheets;
increases or decreases in paper wealth, especially changes in stock prices,
influence consumer spending. A policy-led decline in interest rates pushes
up stock prices, and stockholding households spend more. Recently, however, that relationship seems to have broken down. Why this should be
isn’t clear; it could be that both the stock market and consumer spending
were independently responding to lower interest rates, and that the conclusion that stocks were “causing” the spending changes are a classic example of confusing correlation with causation. Or it may be that the
increasing institutionalization of the market has reduced the effect of stock
prices on personal spending. Or it may have been that household balance
sheets were in such terrible shape in the early 1990s that a bull market was
of little help (Steindel 1992). But whatever the reason, this household application of q theory isn’t quite as impressive as it once was.
But we’ve strayed a bit from Tobin’s original formulation, which was
about the financial influence on real corporate investment. Empirically
speaking, the business relation broke down long before the household
one did. But before we look at the record, a few words on how exactly to
compute q. In their numerator, Tobin and Brainard used the market value
of stocks plus the market value of long-term debt. While good estimates
of the market value of equity are available for both individual firms and
the entire corporate sector, almost on a minute-to-minute basis, the market value of debt can only be estimated, and rather roughly. Keynes’s original observation mentioned only the stock market, and that market is the
one that is constantly valuing and re-valuing corporate capital. The denominator is the value of the firm’s capital stock at replacement cost, though
other researchers have used net worth (assets minus liabilities) in its place.
In practice, the details seem to make little difference, with different versions of q all moving pretty much in unison.8 So for what follows, it hardly
matters which version of q you use.
The data for Tobin and Brainard’s 1977 paper covers 1960 to 1974, a
period for which q seemed to explain investment pretty well. But as the

This version of the q ratio is the total market value of the stocks of nonfinancial corporations divided by the value of the tangible assets (fixed
capital plus inventories), from the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds accounts. Capital expenditures, also from the flow of funds accounts,
include fixed investment plus inventory investment. The S&P 500 is
the Standard and Poor’s index of 500 stocks, deflated by the consumer
price index. Charts cover different years because the quarterly figures
on capital expenditures begin in 1952, while the balance sheet data
begins in 1945. While it looks like investment is once again traveling
along with the q-ratio, record q’s have brought about only a cyclical
expansion in investment, not record-smashing highs. Cash flow (facing
page) still looks like the better explanation.

Internal funds consist of profits plus depreciation allowance, after taxes
and dividends. Capital expenditures include fixed and inventory investment. Rates of change are nominal (uncorrected for inflation). All figures come from the flow of funds accounts, except for GDP, which is
from the national income accounts. Note the tight correlation between
internal funds and investment, and the loose, sometimes inverse, relation between market values and investment. These charts lend great
visual support to the position that firms invest depending on their cash
flow, and not stock market measures like q or share price changes. The
alleged power of stock prices to explain investment may just be a result of their imperfect reflection of corporate cash flows.

147

WALL STREET

chart on page 148 shows, things started going awry even before the paper
was published. While q and investment seemed to move together for the
first half of the chart, they part ways almost at the middle; q collapsed
during the bearish stock markets of the 1970s, yet investment rose.9 And
as q rose with the bull market of the 1980s, investment failed to follow. In
fact, since 1970, a high q has been associated with low investment, and a
low q, with high investment — exactly the opposite of q theory.
The divergence of the 1970s is sometimes explained by the rise in oil
prices, which rendered a lot of older capital equipment obsolete, forcing
firms to invest in new energy-efficient technology. That points up a theoretical problem at the heart of q. The theory is about new investment, or
investment at the margin, as economists say: a new investment will be
undertaken only if it will be applauded by the stock market. But we can
only know how the markets value existing assets; one can only guess at
marginal q. If managers were investing because they had to, they were
apparently doing so without the approval of the stock market. The marginal rationalization may work for a short period of time, but if the marginal q were substantially higher than average q, several years of sustained
investment should have brought up the ratio’s value, and it didn’t. It wasn’t
until the bull market that began in the early 1980s that q began to take off.
Other analysts have argued that while q is a weak explanation of real
investment, changes in stock prices do a better job (Barro 1990). But it
may be that the stock market is simply a leading indicator of the business
cycle, responding quickly to changes in interest rates and central bank
policy, rather than being the independent cause of anything. Randall Morck,
Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny (1990) found that over the period 1960–
1987, the stock market explained very little of the change in real investment once fundamentals like sales and profit growth were controlled for
— relations that held for the stock market and economy taken as a whole,
and for individual firms examined in detail.10 Introducing external financing — new stock and debt issues — added a bit of explanatory power to
their equations, but not much, with new debt doing a better job than equity. Morck & Co. theorize that this may be because firms borrow to sustain investment spending in lean profit years. Their results are confirmed
by Blanchard et al. (1993); fundamentals like profits do a far better job of
explaining changes in real investment than stock market developments.
While it does a terrible job explaining investment, q seems to predict
the stock market and explain mergers. This isn’t surprising; q is another
way of doing what Wall Street analysts call the market-to-book ratio — the
148

MARKET MODELS

market value of a firm’s stock compared with its net worth. Firms selling
below their book value are thought to be bargains, while firms selling
well over book — “well over” being an admittedly spongy concept — are
overpriced. The second of the q charts shows that high q ratios have portended years of poor performance, and low q values, years of bubbliness.
This confirms the notion of so-called “value investors” like Ben Graham
and Warren Buffett that it pays to buy stocks when they’re “cheap,” and
shun or sell them when they’re not.
It’s also almost certain that the takeover and restructuring boom of the
1980s was inspired by the low q of the 1970s. From the late 1970s through
the mid-1980s, it made financial sense to borrow money, buy stock in
undervalued firms, and squeeze them harder. This demand for stock,
though, drove prices higher, and by the end of the 1980s, leveraged buyers were taking on overvalued assets, which is as good an explanation as
any for why the boom collapsed.
Modigliani–Miller: almost nothing matters
Perhaps one of the loveliest financial models was one of the earliest, the
Modigliani–Miller theorem, known as MM among connoisseurs. MM said
that it didn’t really matter how a firm financed itself, with debt or equity, it
was all the same in the end. Before the theorists got hold of the matter, it
was received wisdom that managers are happiest to rely on internal funds,
since, unlike outside investors or lenders, your own money asks no embarrassing questions and makes no unpleasant demands. Next favorite is
debt, though within reason. Loan payments are unforgiving in hard times,
and borrowing should be done with care. Missing a single interest payment can trigger cross-default clauses in loan and bond contracts (an injury to one is an injury to all — solidarity is still in fashion among the
creditor class), meaning the firm can be thrown into involuntary bankruptcy. But as long as you can earn a safely higher rate of return on new
investments than you pay your creditors on new loans, borrowing can
raise profits, and with it the stock price, the criterion of corporate performance. Unlike other countries, lenders usually have little say in the running of a healthy firm in the U.S.; you get outside money with minimal
outside supervision.
Last on the list is selling new stock to public investors. While dividends
are not a fixed payment — though markets do pummel a firm’s stock when
it skips a dividend — selling new stock means a new set of intrusive ab149

WALL STREET

sentee owners. It also means that existing stockholders see their claims
diminished (“diluted,” in the jargon) by the new shareholders.
Along with this pecking-order theory was the supposition that there
was an “ideal” level of debt, that ideal being measured by the financial
structure that maximizes the stock market value of a public corporation. If
a firm had an investment opportunity that offered profits greater than the
interest it would pay on borrowed money, it would make sense to go into
debt to make the investment. But there are only so many opportunities to
earn profits well above the rate of interest; a firm can only expand existing
operations so far before it saturates its market, and managers straying far
from their usual business often screw up badly. Lenders are likely to get
nervous when they see firms piling on debt, and will charge ever higher
rates of interest until they shut off the credit flow. At some point, the profit
rate on new investments will fall below the interest rate on new loans. At
that point, new borrowing would depress profits, and with it the firm’s
stock price. So if you graphed the debt level on the vertical axis and the
stock price on the horizontal, the resulting line would be an upside-down
U — as debt increased, the stock price would rise until the ideal debt level
had been reached, and then turn down again as the firm looked increasingly risky. At least that was the Old Wisdom.
A 1958 article by Franco Modgliani and Merton Miller rejected this orthodoxy, asserting, scandalously, that the “market value of any firm is
independent of its capital structure” and “the average cost of capital to
any firm is completely independent of its capital structure” (Modigliani
and Miller 1958; italics in original).11 Even for an unleveraged firm, debt is
no cheaper than equity, and managers cannot increase the market value
of their firm by moving towards some ideal point of leverage.
Their argument was highly abstract and formal, but boiled down to the
idea that investors could undo the supposed gains from leverage by selling the stocks of firms that increase their indebtedness (since risk increases
with leverage), thereby depressing the share price — or, conversely, investors can create their own leverage by buying bonds directly, preempting the strategies of corporate managers. As Modigliani and Miller put it,
“the gains from being able to tap cheap, borrowed funds are more than
offset for the stockholders by the market’s discounting of the stock for the
added leverage assumed.” Or as Miller once put it in an interview, you
can’t make yourself richer by moving money from one pocket to the other.
Modigliani was actually initially skeptical about their theory, but Miller,
“a passionate believer in the power of free markets to forge optimal and
150

MARKET MODELS

predictable outcomes, stood his ground. ‘I believed it! I felt from the very
beginning that this is right.’” (Bernstein 1992, p. 174). Marxists have often
been accused of practicing religion rather than science, but Miller’s remark shows that market partisans also thrive on busloads of faith.
Though MM argued more by equation than example, they did present
some empirical evidence showing little relation between corporations’ cost
of capital and their financial structure. Their scatter diagrams plotting the
cost of capital versus leverage ratios for 43 electric utilities and 42 oil companies showed no significant pattern.
MM concluded their paper with a list of their model’s shortcomings,
among them its static quality; its assumption of perfect competition, meaning instantaneous and rational price adjustment to new information; and
ease of access to the capital markets. In reality, time frustrates the best
plans; perfect competition exists nowhere, even in the capital markets
where it comes closest to realization; and only giant corporations enjoy
cheap, frictionless access to the financial markets. Model-builders proceed with the faith that such shortcomings (that is, essential features of
actually existing capitalism) only complicate their work without rendering it pointless.
Modigliani and Miller, good bourgeois subjects, looked most closely at
individual firms, not bothering to consider what happens when individual
capitals are aggregated. The possibility that a debt contraction could choke
an economy, just as debt expansion can stimulate it, or signal one in trouble,
or both are all conveniently overlooked by the assumptions. So too the
possibility that a highly indebted economy is more vulnerable to shock
than a mildly indebted one, or that firms with high interest expenses do
less R&D than those with low ones. Nor did Modigliani and Miller consider the different institutional arrangements and social patterns behind
the words “debt” and “equity” — the dispersed patterns of U.S. financial
markets, say, compared to the tighter worlds of Germany and Japan.
Five years later, Modigliani and Miller (1963) revised themselves, confessing that they had ignored the tax benefits of going into hock. Since
U.S. corporations can deduct interest payments, but not stock dividends,
from their taxable income, an increase in leverage is certain to reduce a
firm’s tax rate. MM counseled that this does not mean that corporations
should borrow themselves silly; lenders get stricter as a firm’s indebtedness rises, and managers would never want to run up all their credit lines
and leave no reserve for bad times.
The MM thesis, even with its tax modifications, became so widely ac151

WALL STREET

cepted in the academic literature that interest in the relation between finance and the real world faded to near-invisibility. In the words of a paper that would challenge this orthodoxy 30 years later, MM’s triumph
“dominated the investment literature until recently…largely because of
[its] theoretical appeal” (Cantor 1990). It also made the life of modelbuilding economists much easier; as Mark Gertler (1988) put it, “Apart
from its formal elegance, the MM theorem was attractive because it provided researchers with a rigorous justification for abstracting from the complications induced by financial considerations.” For one thing, you needed
fewer variables in your equations if you did, and for another, it fit in nicely
with the orthodox preference for individualism: you could focus only on
the firm or the household as your unit of analysis, and ignore broader
social institutions like the structure of financial markets (or even the state).
Neoclassical theories of investment, for example, were developed without any regard to finance. Under the influence of Milton Friedman, economists paid attention only to money but not credit — that is, the medium of
exchange used to grease immediate purchases and sales, but not the longerterm obligations used to finance investment and consumption.
But MM’s influence went well beyond the academy, as leverage artists,
their bankers, and their apologists chanted a debt-doesn’t-matter mantra
throughout the 1980s mania. Forgetting the message in the 1958 paper
about how debt can’t really make you better off, another MM, Michael
Milken, used the theory to convince people that debt doesn’t hurt either,
and thanks to tax deductibility, it really can make you better off. Here’s
how Business Week (Farrell and Nathans 1989) characterized the popular
influence of the MM theory, just after a wave of high-profile leveraged
buyouts went bad in the summer of 1989:
The rationale for such financings…dates back to seminal work in the late
1950s by two eminent economists, Merton H. Miller and Franco Modigliani.
In essence, the economists reasoned that a company’s earning power, not
its financial makeup, is what determines its market value. So high leverage
makes sense, since the tax code lets companies deduct the interest they
pay…. Depite their bold logic — remember, debt was anathema back then
— it was more than two decades before their ideas took hold, and that was
largely through Mike Milken’s canny nurturing of the market for less-thaninvestment-grade [i.e., junk] bonds.

Similar arguments, without the skepticism inspired by the sequence of
leverage disasters in the summer of 1989, were common in the business
152

MARKET MODELS

press throughout the 1980s. For example, writing just before the Summer
of Defaults, Euromoney (Thackray 1989) argued that the $200–400 billion
in recent corporate restructurings were not enough — that work had only
just begun, and that a quasi-Trotskyist doctrine of permanent restructuring was well advised by “the rise of modern corporate finance theory.”
Work that had originally said that capital structure didn’t matter had
spawned an industry, or at least an apology for that industry, based on the
perpetual transformation of those structures.

how finance matters
Such observations drawn from mere journalism might be dismissed as
hopelessly anecdotal by academics, but the notion that finance matters
began bubbling up to prominence in the late 1970s. Ironically, one of the
papers often cited by the finance revisionists, Gurley and Shaw (1955),
was quickly eclipsed by the MM theorem, barely to resurface for more
than 20 years. But Gurley and Shaw’s arguments are still important. They
claimed that one of the important differences between developed and
undeveloped economies is the depth of the financial system; in a youthful
economy, banks may play a primary role as a repository for savings and a
source of credit, but in a more advanced economy, a far broader array of
institutional forms connect savers and borrowers. So, in the simpler
economy, the Friedmanite focus on money, defined as currency, checking accounts, and short-term savings deposits, is sensible, because it captures most of the financial aspects of exchange, but in a complex one,
financial innovation leaves simpler forms of money way behind. According to Gurley and Shaw, what really mattered most in a complex economy
was “financial capacity,” a measure of borrowers’ ability to absorb debt.
Thus financial structure mattered a great deal to real economic activity; an
economy populated by firms and households burdened by debt was one
that was near a breaking point, but one populated by units light on debt
had plenty of room to grow. A few economists continued this tradition
during the 1960s and early 1970s, but the MM orthodoxy prevailed — and
was a staple of the business school curriculum that shaped a generation of
managers and financiers.
Economics is rarely given a chance to be tested by experimentation on
real societies, but finance theory underwent an exhaustive real-world test
during the 1980s and early 1990s. After that experience, it’s hard to argue
that financial structure doesn’t matter. For example, a study by Richard
Cantor (1990) of the behavior of 586 companies over the 17-year period
153

WALL STREET

from 1971 to 1986 showed that highly indebted firms showed greater volatility in investment and employment than those with low debt levels. That
is, in good times, high-debt firms were likely to expand quickly, but in
bad times, they tended to cut back just as quickly — a generalization that
certainly fit the U.S. economy in the 1980s and early 1990s.
Cantor speculated that high leverage may encourage “a risk-averse attitude on the part of management,” so that a drop in sales (of the sort one
sees in a normal recession) “may lead firms to postpone investment and
strenuously avoid inventory buildup, even if they are experiencing offsetting improvements in interest or other expenses.” The need to remain
current in servicing one’s debts may take precedence over all else in the
managerial mind.
Cantor was influenced by the work of Steven M. Fazzari, R. Glenn
Hubbard, and Bruce C. Petersen (1988), who found rich links between
financial structure and investment practices. Most investment models,
Fazzari et al. argued, are based on a “representative firm” that responds to
the cues of the securities markets. If the representative firm lacks the funds
for an investment that passes orthodox financial muster, that should be no
obstacle; external funds are a perfect substitute for internal funds. “[W]ith
perfect capital markets, a firm’s investment decisions are independent of
its financial condition.” After MM, classic notions that firms have a hierarchy of preferences in raising funds — internal funds, debt, and stock, in
descending order of appeal — were out of fashion.
Much turns on how you define a representative firm. While large, established corporations may enjoy easy access to other people’s money,
small, youngish ones don’t. To measure the importance of this distinction,
Fazzari and his colleagues looked at 422 manufacturing firms in the Value
Line database that were alive for the entire period from 1969 to 1984, sorting them into three groups depending on what portion of their profits
they paid out in dividends.
Fazzari and colleagues reasoned that if financial constraints were unimportant, investment would be largely independent of a firm’s cash flow:
firms facing lean times could maintain their investment program simply
by raising outside money. They used dividend payout ratios (percentage
of profits paid out in dividends) as a proxy for financial constraint. Firms
paying out less than 10% — 49 of the sample 422 firms — were placed in
class 1; those paying more than 10% but less than 20%, class 2; and those
paying more than 20%, class 3. As the table shows, sales growth and investment rates decline as you mount the class ladder, as does the correla154

MARKET MODELS

tion between cash flow (mainly profits plus depreciation allowances) and
investment. Since cash flow is volatile, investment among the constrained
firms is also more volatile than among unconstrained firms (as their respective standard deviation figures show).
At least three conclusions emerge. First, firms that could most profitably use external finance seem to have the least access to it, while those
firms with the least promising investment prospects are suffused with surfinancial constraints and investment

plus cash. Second, smaller, cash-constrained firms are extremely vulnerable to changes in the economic environment; changes in interest rates
and sales growth will quickly translate into rapid changes in investment.12
An anti-inflation regime of tight money will leave large, mature firms mostly
unscathed, while squeezing those with the best prospects. And third, theorizing aside, financial structure does matter, and it matters a lot.
Examples drawn from recent experience are nothing compared to those
drawn from the 1930s. Ben S. Bernanke (1983) argued that the Great
Depression’s length and severity were aggravated by the increased costs
of credit intermediation, which is an economist’s way of saying that the
banking system stopped working as it’s supposed to — efficiently matching savers and borrowers.
In severely abnormal times, Bernanke argued, this process of intermediation is disrupted, as savers shun the banking system and bankers hoard
what little funds are entrusted to them. Though we saw some of these
abnormal behaviors during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the recent events
were nothing when compared with the 1930s. From 1929 to 1933, almost
155

WALL STREET

10,000 banks failed; between failures and mergers, the number of banks
was reduced by nearly half over those four years. At the same time, individual and business borrowers were going bust in unprecedented number. Of 22 major cities surveyed in 1934, default rates on residential
properties ranged from a low of 21% in Richmond to 62% in Cleveland,
with the majority clustering around 40%. A year earlier, 45% of all U.S.
farmers were delinquent on mortgages. As of March 1934, 37 of the 310
cities with populations over 30,000 were in default, as were three states.
Among businesses, however, the picture was uneven. Aggregate corporate profits before taxes were negative in 1931 and 1932, the only years
the business sector as a whole has been in the red since the national income accounts began in 1929. But these losses were borne mainly by
small and mid-sized businesses; firms with assets over $50 million remained
profitable throughout the period, while those with assets under $50,000
suffered losses equal to 33% of their capitalization in 1932 alone.13
In these circumstances, it’s not hard to see why the process of credit
intermediation froze nearly solid. Customers with spare cash — an increasingly rare species in the early 1930s — avoided depositing it in banks.
Simultaneously, frightened bankers called in loans — those, of course,
that weren’t already in default — and refused to make new ones, preferring instead to stash their money in U.S. Treasury bills. Though big corporations remained largely unscathed, the shutdown of bank credit hurt small
businesses, farmers, and households. No doubt the cascade of defaults,
insolvencies, and bank failures fed on itself, since credit was denied even
to borrowers who could have put it to good use.
Though the banking crisis came to an end in March 1933 with Roosevelt’s
bank holiday — the very month officially recognized as the trough of the
1929–33 contraction — small businesses still found it difficult to borrow
money at least through 1935, and possibly 1938, according to a number of
surveys cited by Bernanke. The home mortgage market was similarly frozen; what lending took place was the result of New Deal credit programs.
Frederic S. Mishkin (1978) argued, in a paper now seen as a milepost in
the revival of interest in finance, that financial mechanisms at the household level were also important in propagating the Depression — not as
causes, really, but as part of the transmission mechanism of the economic
implosion. During the 1920s, almost certainly encouraged by the stock
market boom, households had taken on enormous liabilities, which suddenly became quite “embarrassing,” in the charming old formulation, when
the prices of stocks and real estate began their collapse in late 1929. Worse,
156

MARKET MODELS

the general deflation — consumer prices fell by almost 25% between 1929
and 1933 — sharply increased the real debt burden. From 1929 to 1935,
real household net worth fell almost 12% (according to Mishkin’s estimates), a function of simultaneously declining asset values and rising liabilities. The situation improved in the mid-1930s, but the recession and
stock market decline of 1937–38 brought a rerun, in less dramatic form, of
the 1929–33 horrorshow. Mishkin speculated that these balance sheet pressures (and the psychological pressures they gave rise to) caused solvent
consumers to defer major purchases. Financial crisis, in other words, translated into a decline in demand for housing and durable goods, purchases
that typically require both borrowed funds and faith that there will be
sufficient income in the future to service the loans.
In a classic paper, Irving Fisher (1933) argued that financial involvement made all the difference between routine downturns (not yet called
recessions) and big-time collapses like 1873 and 1929. Typically, such a
collapse followed upon a credit-powered boom, which left businesses
excessively debt-burdened, unable to cope with an economic slowdown.
The process, which he labeled a debt deflation, was fairly simple, and
makes great intuitive sense, but it was an argument largely forgotten by
mainstream economics in the years after World War II. A mild slowdown,
caused perhaps by some shock to confidence, leaves debtors unable to
meet their obligations out of current cash flows. To satisfy their creditors,
they liquidate assets, which depresses the prices of real goods. The general deflation in prices makes their current production unprofitable, since
cost structures were predicated on older, higher sales prices, at the same
time it increases the real value of their debt burden. So firms cut back on
production, employment falls and demand falls with it, profits turn into
losses, the debt burdens further increase, net worths sink into negative
territory — and so on into perdition. Fisher argued that there was nothing
on the horizon to stop the process from continuing in 1933 — until
Roosevelt took office and declared a bank holiday on March 4. This state
intervention broke the destructive pattern; otherwise, claimed Fisher, the
collapse would have taken out whole new realms of the economy, leading inevitably to the bankruptcy of the U.S. government.14 The implication, then, is that such deflations are impossible today, because
governments will intervene at a far earlier stage (Minsky 1982b).
The theoretical message of the Depression experience is that finance
matters a great deal to both businesses and households, and is anything
but neutral. The impact seems to come less from valuation (shown by the
157

WALL STREET

irrelevance of q to investment spending and the weak relations between
asset prices and consumer spending) than from the bite of interest payments on current incomes and the availability of credit (that is, the ability
to roll over old debts and get fresh loans). Finance is a powerful stimulus
on the way up, and can be a powerful depressant on the way down.
These analyses of the financial mechanisms behind the Great Depression are illuminating for recent history as well, particularly the recession
of the early 1990s, which confused no less an observer than Fed chair
Alan Greenspan. “No models can explain the types of patterns we are
having,” Greenspan said on an October 1992 visit to Japan. “This is really
a quite extraordinarily difficult type of environment” (Sterngold 1992). In
his theorizing, Greenspan was a conventional economist schooled in the
neutrality-of-money faith — but as a practical central banker, he knew
that the Fed had to drive interest rates down or the economy would have
sunk into depression. He did just that, and it didn’t.
A telephone-book-sized compendium of studies by New York Fed
economists (Federal Reserve Bank of New York 1994) confirms the thesis
that the fevered boom of the 1980s was fueled by an exceptionally heavy
use of credit — federal, business, and household — and that the 1989–92
slump (a broader period of sluggishness than the official recession of July
1990 to March 1991) was caused by a breakdown in the credit machinery.
While it’s difficult to specify precisely the components of that breakdown
— how much could be ascribed to a loss of Gurley and Shaw’s financial
capacity, as debt-burdened borrowers found themselves unwilling or unable to borrow more; how much to the collapse of the S&Ls and the junk
bond market, and the resulting shrinkage in the supply of new credit; and
how much to the reluctance of surviving lenders to lend to risky clients —
it’s almost certain that all these elements contributed something to the
slump. The loss of bank credit to small business seems, from the New
York Fed’s work, to be of crucial importance. Extrapolating from their
work, it’s also virtually certain that the initially weak recovery from the
1991 recession low was in large part a result of the crippling of the credit
machinery. Even the extraordinary fiscal stringency of recent years can be
seen in this light, as the U.S. government’s own financial capacity was
severely strained, and deficit reduction kept the brake on real economic
activity from the 1990 budget deal onwards (the mirror image of the intensely stimulative Reagan deficits of the 1980s).15
When the early 1990s recession officially began in July 1990, it was not
unreasonable to expect the first debt deflation in 60 years. Total debts of
158

MARKET MODELS

nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) were almost 15 times pretax profits, compared with under 11 times in 1929. Interest payments claimed 39% of pretax
profits, compared with 14% in 1929.16
Here again, Bernanke and colleagues (Bernanke and Campbell 1988;
Bernanke, Campbell, and Whited 1990 — BCW) have done illuminating
work. BCW discovered that the increase in corporate debt averages was
not across-the-board, but was instead concentrated among a small number of firms. But the debt leaders had driven themselves into a hideous
bind. The median firm in the BCW sample of about 1,200 publicly traded
firms devoted 22% of its cash flow to interest payments in 1988, up from
13% in 1969, but no increase from 1980’s 22%. At the 90th percentile, however, firms devoted 186% of their cash flow to interest in 1988, up from
34% in 1969, and 56% in 1980. The calculation is impossible at the 95th
percentile, since those firms lost money — a situation that had persisted
since 1982; in 1969, these firms were profitable, and paid 44% of cash flow
in interest. Though BCW did not say, it is safe to assume that firms at the
70th and 80th percentile were barely earning their interest payments.
Using financial data like profits, stock prices, and interest rates running
through 1986, Bernanke and Campbell (1988) simulated recessions as severe as those of 1973–75 and 1980–82; they projected that 10% of U.S.
corporations could face bankruptcy in a comparable downturn. Updating
their work in 1990, incorporating data from the debt-mad years 1987 and
1988, BCW estimated that 20–25% would face insolvency in a deep recession. The authors emphasized that these were measures of financial stress,
not literal predictions. Needless to say, if anything like 10% of U.S. firms
had gone under, the crisis would almost certainly have cascaded into a
severe depression.
We had a recession, but no depression. While thousands of firms —
60,746 in 1990, 87,266 in 1991, and some 90,000 in 1992 — went bust,
each year’s failures represented fewer than 1% of all U.S. businesses. Liabilities of firms that failed in 1991 totaled $108.8 billion, a lot of money,
but less than 2% of business debts.
The charts help explain why things never got worse. They show the
course of some important financial variables over three recessions, 1973–
75, 1980–82, and 1990–92. To be sure, the timing of the three slumps isn’t
perfectly matched; their official lifespans are November 1973–March 1975,
January 1980–July 1980 and again from July 1981–November 1982 (two
back-to-back downdrafts that felt like one long one), and July 1990–March
1991 (though real recovery didn’t begin until 1992). But all three show
159

WALL STREET

peaks in the first year, and two of them show troughs in the third, so this is
close enough.
Scrutiny of the graphs shows: in the 1990–92 swoon, interest rates fell,
but in the others they rose; profits were flat, unlike 1980–82, when they
fell 40%; and stock prices rose 20%, instead of falling, as they did in the
financial measures in three recessions

Charts show the course of several important financial measures affecting nonfinancial
corporations during three recessionary periods, 1973–75, 1980–82, and 1990–92.
For each indicator, the value of the first year (1973, 1980, 1990) is set to 100, and
values for the second and third years of each period are expressed as an index
number relative to the first. The absolute levels for each period vary; the point of this
exercise is to examine changes, not absolutes. In order, charts show interest rate
for Baa-rated corporate bonds (firms rated Baa lie between blue-chip and junk status);
net interest paid by nonfinancial corporations (NFCs); pretax profits of NFCs; the
ratio of those interest payments to earnings [profits] before interest and taxes (EBIT);
equity [stock] values of NFCs; and the ratio of those equity values to the debts of
NFCs. Assets and liabilities from the flow of funds accounts; interest and profits,
from the NIPAs.

two prior recessions. Consequently, the average business was able to meet
its interest bill, and the value of its equity stayed above the value of its
debt, keeping it solvent. Had the 1990–91 recession been more like the
earlier two, average debt/equity ratios would have been 100% (meaning
that heavily indebted firms would have been under deep water) instead
of 60%, and interest would have taken a bigger bite of profits — in the
160

MARKET MODELS

range of 42–55%, close to the levels of 1933–34 (though still below those
of 1931 and 1932). Bond rates would have been 12–13%, not 9%. BCW
haven’t updated their work, but it’s likely that firms at their 95th percentile
went to the wall but those at the 85th got by, or something like that.
Both borrowers and lenders got debt-shy in the early 1990s. After retiring a net of $641 billion in stock between 1984 and 1990, mainly through
leveraged buyouts, share repurchases, and takeovers (hostile and otherwise), U.S. nonfinancial corporations finally used the stock market for its
alleged purpose from 1991 to 1993, raising a total of $67 billion total in net
new equity. Rather than financing new investment, those stock issues
mainly went to pay off old debts. Debt issuance slowed from $1.3 trillion
from 1984 through 1990, an average of $185 billion a year, to $77 billion
from 1991–93, or $26 billion a year, an 86% fall in the annual pace of debt
creation. The low level of net borrowing for 1991–93 disguises a heavy
gross issuance; firms were busily exchanging new, lower-interest-rate debt,
for old, high-rate debt, and short-term debt for long (Remolona et al. 1992–
93, pp. 15–19). By 1994, firms’ balance sheets were significantly repaired,
and the debt service burden was considerably lightened.17
It wasn’t luck that gave us this turn of events, but government policy —
the bank and S&L bailouts and sustained indulgence by the Fed. The welfare state may have been shredded for the poor, but not for big finance,
which can screw up grandly and still count on an expensive rescue.
efficient markets
Does it matter to a larger public whether the stock market is “efficient” or
not? Here’s one view of why it does, from some conventional economists:
To reject the Efficient Market Hypothesis for the whole stock market…implies
broadly that production decisions based on stock prices will lead to inefficient capital allocations. More generally, if the application of rational expectations theory to the virtually “ideal” conditions provided by the stock market
fails, then what confidence can economists have in its application to other
areas of economics…? (Marsh and Merton 1986, quoted in Fortune 1991).

The answer to the confidence question, as we’ll see, is not much.

the view from 1970
Perhaps the easiest way to consider the vast literature on market efficiency
is to focus on two reviews of the state of the art written by Eugene Fama of
the University of Chicago, the first in 1970, when the theory was in high
161

WALL STREET

flower, and the second in 1991, when it had taken serious hits. Fama opened
his canonical 1970 review of the efficient market theory18 as follows:
The primary role of the capital market is allocation of ownership of the
economy’s capital stock. In general terms, the ideal is a market in which
prices provide accurate signals for resource allocation: that is, a market in
which firms can make production–investment decisions, and investors can
choose among the securities that represent ownership of firms’ activities
under the assumption that security prices at any time “fully reflect” all available information. A market in which prices always “fully reflect” available
information is called “efficient.”19

The words in quotation marks carry heavy baggage. Fama acknowledged that “fully reflect” is a pretty mushy phrase, so vague as to be statistically untestable. Stock prices must always represent investors’ best
opinions of the prospects of their underlying firms; if this is the case, then
the allocation of capital they symbolize must be optimal. To a purely financial theorist, efficient prices are ones that reflect all available information. To an economist, an efficient allocation is one that produces the
maximum output for a given set of inputs — a rare case of economics
echoing colloquial usage. Unfortunately the two meanings are easily confused, leading to much intellectual and political mischief.
Fama distinguished among three varieties of the EMH: the weak, semistrong, and strong forms. The weak form asserts that the past course of
security prices says nothing about their future meanderings. The semistrong form asserts that security prices adjust almost instantaneously to
significant news (profits announcements, dividend changes, etc.). And the
strong form asserts that there is no such thing as a hidden cadre of “smart
money” investors who enjoy privileged access to information that isn’t
reflected in public market prices.
EM theory turns in part on what the definition of the “right” price of a
stock or other financial asset should be, since in an efficient world, the
market price should be more or less identical to the right one. How, then,
should a stock be priced?20 The preferred model that grew up alongside
the EMH holds that the key to pricing any asset is its riskiness. That has a
common-sense appeal, but the professors of finance have a special view
of risk. In the Sharpe–Lintner–Black model (SLB, named after William
Sharpe, John Lintner, and Fisher Black), also known as the capital asset
pricing model (CAPM, pronounced cap-em), risk is defined as the volatility of an asset’s expected returns — its variance around a norm — ex162

MARKET MODELS

pressed in comparison to some benchmark, usually a “riskless” investment like Treasury bills. Risk, then, is not the possibility of loss in the
colloquial sense, but the likelihood of deviation from an expected return.
A security’s characteristic risk is called its beta (or β, depending on
your typographical preferences). The higher the beta, the higher the “expected” return. In the CAPM, a riskless investment like a bank deposit or a
Treasury bill sets the baseline return; the further up the risk scale you
move, the higher the expected return. Stocks in general are riskier than Tbills, so stocks in general should offer higher compensatory rewards; the
stock of a high-tech firm is likelier to be far more volatile than a
soapmakers’s, so the high-tech stock should offer the better return. In the
classic formula, then, the return on an individual stock equals the riskless
interest rate plus a premium for its relative volaility.
Were these risk and return relationships graphed, they would yield an
upward-sloping line, known as the security market line (SML), because
the return demanded rises with risk. In an efficient market, asset prices
should fall on the line. Should one fall above it — indicating a return
higher than warranted by risk — or below it, then the market is inefficient.
Needless to say, the real world is far messier than the theory, and Fama
himself would challenge it in a 1992 paper (discussed below). But over
the long term, the relationship between risk and reward does more or less
hold, even if not with mathematical perfection; while year-to-year returns
may vary wildly, over decades, stocks are far more profitable than riskless
investments — though why this is has not been convincingly explained.
Most theory speaks of expected returns, which are little more than
guesses based on history. In the early days of EM theory, this was largely
ignored, since expectations were assumed to be rational, but the devils
hiding in this assumption will be revealed later on. Fama acknowledged,
in his typically fair-minded way, that this notion of expected returns is a
mathematical concept that should not be imbued “with any special importance.” Instead, it is a methodological necessity, “the unavoidable price
one must pay to give the theory of efficient markets empirical content.”
No one can see an expected return; one can only extrapolate from past
experience. In more popular, more ideological versions of efficient market theory, expectations are imbued with an almost mystical importance:
the collective wisdom of “the market” is treated as if it were omniscient.
Notions of market efficiency have their roots in a long-standing observation that it’s damn hard to beat the market, and that prices seem to move
in random ways. Louis Bachelier argued in a 1900 study (that was ignored
163

WALL STREET

for 60 years) that over the long term, speculators should consistently earn
no extraordinary profits; market prices, in other words, are a “fair game.”
Another precursor of EM theory was Alfred Cowles, who showed in two
studies (Cowles 1933; 1944) that a variety of forecasts by pundits and investment professionals yielded results that were at best no better than the
overall market, and often quite worse.
In the more modern form, market efficiency partisans hold that the
courses of prices constitute something like a “random walk,” meaning that
they cannot be predicted, since their day-to-day variations — oscillations
around some fundamental value, as determined by expected future return — do not follow a pattern significantly different from what chance
would specify. Almost no one has access to special information denied
most market participants. The practical implication is that punters can’t
beat the market by moving in and out of the stock market as a whole or
from one set of stocks to another in accordance with their evaluations of
the market’s prospects; the best thing they can do is buy a broad variety of
stocks and hold them patiently through good times and bad.
As Fama noted, these notions of efficiency all assume: (1) there are no
transaction costs in trading securities; (2) information is disseminated
equally among all market participants; and (3) all participants hold similar
interpretations of that information. Efficient prices are those formed by
the frictionless buying and selling of equally endowed participants.
Of course, none of these conditions are true. Commissions and taxes
make buying and selling relatively expensive; institutional investors employ a bevy of pricey analysts and subscribe to hundreds of equally pricey
news and analytical services, while smaller fry depend on instinct or rumor; and interpretations diverge. As they say on Wall Street, people buy a
stock because they think it’s going to go up, but they usually buy it from
someone who thinks it’s likely to go down. If everyone held identical
opinions, there would be no trading. These real-world conditions should
not be fatal to the EM enterprise, Fama argued; reality is close enough to
theory to justify the theoretical pursuit.
Even the occasional anomalies that were uncovered in the 1960s —
mainly those showing serial correlations (that is, some persistence in price
changes from one period to the next, or in plain English, trends) in stock
prices over the very short term, meaning a single day or just several hours
— were too small to be traded profitably; even professionals who trade at
minuscule commissions could not take advantage of these trendlets. Other
evidence cited by Fama showed that large price changes are likely to be
164

MARKET MODELS

followed by large price changes, though there was no pattern to the signs
of the successor changes; a large upward change one day would probably
be followed by a large change the next day, but the change on the second
day was as likely to be down as up. Needless to say, such a discovery is
not of much help to speculators.
Tests of the semi-strong form of the EMH during the 1960s consisted of
observations of stock prices just before and after important announcements like stock splits, dividend changes, and the like. These provide statistical confirmation of the Wall Street axiom to buy the rumor and sell the
news: most of the change in price around such announcements occurs
before their public release, suggesting that a significant fraction of investors are remarkably prescient, remarkably skilled at analyzing public information, or remarkably well-informed.
Even in 1970, the strong form of the EMH was empirically the weakest
of the three versions. One 1966 study cited by Fama showed that stock
exchange specialists generally traded profitably over 80% of the time, a
sharp blow to the idea that smart money investors do not exist. This fits
with popular belief that being a specialist is virtually a license to print
money (though specialists, of course, deny this). Other studies during the
1960s showed that corporate insiders — senior managers and
boardmembers of publicly held firms — were also able to buy and sell
with better-than-average timing. This observation concerns only legal insider trading, which must be reported to the SEC and which is not supposed to be based on access to specific juicy bits of information. It would
be illegal for a CEO to sell her stock a week in advance of a nasty announcement that will take Wall Street by surprise — a disastrous loss,
perhaps, or an unfavorable regulatory development. But should she sell
on the basis of an informed judgment that the firm faced a rocky year or
two, that would not only be entirely legal, but also quite well-advised.
Even if they do have access to privileged information on which they
can profitably trade, specialists and corporate insiders are nonetheless a
small class of investors. Studies of professional money managers, supposedly the most sophisticated investors outside denizens of boardrooms and
the stock exchange floor, show them consistently unable to beat the market. Of course, as professionals have come to dominate trading, replacing
individual investors, pros have become the market, and cannot reasonably be expected to beat themselves. Still, if most professional money
managers can do no better than market averages, why do they deserve
those high salaries?
165

WALL STREET

In sum, the weak form of market efficiency looked quite firmly established in 1970, despite a few minor anomalies. So too the semi-strong
form. Even the strong form, which Fama said should be “best viewed as a
benchmark against which deviations from market efficiency…can be
judged,” looked respectable, despite the specialist and insider exceptions.
It is quite a leap to say that because it is unpredictable, the stock market
is efficient, and another broad leap to argue that such efficiency means
that the stock market’s influence over the allocation of real capital is efficient in the economic sense. But in 1970, Fama’s analysis seemed to be
irrefutable on its own terms.

the view from 1991
Twenty-one years later, Fama (1991) returned to survey the state of efficient market theory, and found it under challenge from several quarters.
Fama began by defining efficiency as the “simple statement that security prices fully reflect all available information.” What is that information?
The sum of investor expectations about the future. But are these stable or
rational, and where do they come from anyway? In testing for market efficiency, Fama pointed out, “we can only test whether information is properly reflected in prices in the context of a pricing model that defines the
meaning of ‘properly.’” Tests of the EMH, then, are simultaneously tests of
how accurately investors divine the future and how accurately stock prices
represent that consensus — meaning that the EMH had a “joint hypothesis” problem, in the jargon of the trade.
If prices reflect bad information efficiently, is that a good thing? Investors overvalued U.S. corporations in the early 1970s, and undervalued them
later in the decade; prices correctly reflected this consensus, but in both
cases the consensus was “wrong” in retrospect. Fama brought up the point
only to drop it, but it does seem to have rather serious implications for the
wisdom and reliability of stock market pricing and investment decisions
influenced by its signals.
Terminology, Fama noted, had changed over the two decades since his
last review. The weak, semi-strong, and strong forms of the EMH had
earned more descriptive names: tests for return predictability, event studies, and tests for private information. Following Fama, let’s look at the
state of the art in the early 1990s.
Return predictability. Work in the 1980s, using different — a skeptic on
econometrics hesitates to use the phrase “more powerful” — statistical
166

MARKET MODELS

techniques, repeatedly found more patterns in prices than classic random
walk theory allowed, especially if you examine portfolios consisting of a
number of stocks. In other words, individual shares may follow more-orless random patterns, but the market as a whole moves in trends (or, in
statistical language, returns are autocorrelated), especially over the long
term. “[R]ecent research,” Fama concluded, “is able to show confidently
that daily and weekly returns are predictable from past returns.”
Even more challenging to EMH orthodoxy is research that goes beyond
price history. A number of studies during the 1970s and 1980s showed
that stocks with low price/earnings ratios and/or high dividend yields —
“cheap” stocks, in slang — would likely outperform stocks that were expensive by these measures, a sophisticated confirmation of old Wall Street
wisdom. Other research, including Fama’s own (Fama and French 1989),
showed that stocks are a good buy when the long-term interest rates are
well above short-term ones, and when the gap between interest rates on
risky and safe corporate bonds is wide, and a bad buy when the opposite
conditions prevail, though the relationship is far from perfect. The first set
of circumstances is usually associated with recession and/or financial anxiety, and the second set with good times — another way of saying that
stocks anticipate turns in the business cycle, though not without giving
quite a few false signals. Again, this looks like a fancy confirmation of
Street wisdom.
Fama also reported some bad news for the Sharpe–Lintner–Black/CAPM
pricing model. The early 1970s, Fama recalled, were a euphoric time for
financial theorists; the SLB theory for a moment seemed to have “solved”
the problem of pricing securities. “We should have known better,” Fama
wrote. “The SLB model is just a model and so surely false.” For a model
building profession, this is an odd discovery, but Fama went on to defend
SLB and model-building in general by saying it was useful to discover the
ways in which it is proved false, which might be true if the model builders
had approached the world with humility rather than euphoria.
Though it is still reverently taught to business school students, there
are simply too many anomalies to sustain the pure SLB beta model, most
importantly the size effect. “Small” stocks, as measured by market capitalization (price times the number of shares outstanding) show excessively
high returns relative to their betas, and “big” stocks, excessively low returns. Also, the relation between beta and return (with more volatile stocks
showing higher returns), which was first posited in the 1960s and 1970s,
breaks down when applied to more recent price history. Either the first
167

WALL STREET

“discovery” was anomalous, or it ceased to work as the investing public
became aware of the technique.
A 1992 paper by Fama and Kenneth French that reported very damaging evidence for the beta model — that firm size and the ratio of market
value to book value are better predictors of return than relative volatility
— excited the ideologists at The Economist (1992c) to a defense. “Should
analysts stop using the CAPM? Probably not,” the magazine declared in its
best ex cathedra tone. And why not? Because while Fama and French
“have produced intriguing results, they lack a theory to explain them.”
That is true enough; Fama and French were uncertain whether they’d uncovered something rational or not rational. (It’s quite amazing to see the
1970 partisan of market efficiency even entertain the notion of irrationality 22 years later.) But as The Economist put it, the choice for practitioners
and theorists is whether to believe evidence without theory, or “stick with
a theory that, despite the data, is built on impeccable logic.” The magazine’s
preference, clearly enough, was for theory over evidence.
A small flood of studies appeared in the years after the Fama–French
paper, subjecting the CAPM to fresh scrutiny, some defending it against
the heretics, and others supporting the heresy (for example, Kothari et al.
1995, and Cohen and Polk 1996). A review of recent work (Jagannathan
and McGrattan 1995) makes it clear that evaluations of the model are highly
dependent on the nature of the evidence used.21 Different time periods, or
different sets of stocks, or different measures of return (monthly or annual) produce wildly different results. The message seems to be that, yes,
the more volatile an asset, the higher its likely return over the very long
term, but the relation escapes precise quanitification of the sort most conventional economists crave. Since CAPM is not only used to analyze financial markets, but is also used by corporate managers to decide on real
investments, the model’s fate is of more than technical interest.
Though CAPM still has its adherents, one of the more influential alternative approaches to stock valuation is arbitrage pricing theory (APT) (Ross
1976). In APT, the price of an asset depends on the prices of a number of
related assets, though the number of other assets and their nature isn’t
specified by the theory. An APT model of the stock market (Chen, Roll,
and Ross 1986), for example, found that the best predictors of future return are the growth rate of industrial production (with future returns high
when industrial production has been weak, and vice versa) and the spread
between interest rates on low-grade corporate bonds and long-term government bonds (with future returns high when the spread is wide). This
168

MARKET MODELS

looks remarkably like Wall Street common sense; common sense can often be stupid, but not always.
The problem, though, with so-called multifactor models like APT is
that analysts can play with the data, adding and subtracting influences,
until they find a combination that works. This danger is always present in
mathematical economics; Fama’s review is full of warnings about the dangers of data farming and model dredging. In economics, one rarely knows
for sure, despite all the pretense of science. And, as always, one uses historical relations to predict future prices — which is admittedly all one can
use, but it’s still a long way from physics.
Event studies. These studies are relatively easy to do, and can offer more
definitive results than most. Stock prices will either react or not react to an
announcement; the reaction will either persist or decay. So it’s no wonder
that the finance literature is filled with event studies.
There’s little doubt now that stocks do respond quickly to new information, with occasional exceptions. Two interesting recent discoveries,
however, dethrone some classic theoretical notions. The first is that unexpected changes in dividends tend to push stock prices in the same direction — up when the dividend is boosted, down when it’s cut. This violates
MM theory, which holds that dividend policy should be irrelevant to the
stock price. There may be several reasons for this. One possibility is that
investors are more emotional than theoreticians allow for, and their reaction to dividend changes is a triumph of gut reaction over rational analysis. Another possibility is that corporate managers use dividends to signal
major changes in the long-term prospects for the firm (or that investors
perceive them as such). A dividend cut is a way of saying the corporation
is in deep trouble; a boost, especially a large, unexpected one, a way of
saying the future is brighter than anyone had realized.
The second interesting discovery is that a new issue of stock tends to
be bad news for future prices. The classic assumption was that a stock
issue is a sign of a firm’s confidence in its future; additionally, the infusion
of fresh capital should be good nourishment for future profits. But this
seems not to be the case. The most reasonable explanation is that managers issue stock when they think it’s overvalued — another sharp blow at
the notion of efficiency. More on both these topics a little later.
(Out)performance. Here, 20 years of studies generally confirm classic EM
theory: it’s devilishly difficult to beat the market. The exceptions discussed
169

WALL STREET

above, stock exchange specialists and corporate insiders, still prevail. Even
though information on (legal) insider trading is fairly widely available, the
market apparently does not make adequate use of it — though it’s hard to
imagine this anomaly persisting forever. Professional security analysts and
money managers are largely unable to do better than the market, with one
notable exception, the stock rankings published by the Value Line
Investment Survey.
Unfortunately, even the Value Line information, while theoretically interesting, is of little practical importance. Stock prices adjust speedily to
Value Line upgradings, meaning that all but the nimblest or best-connected
investors are denied the opportunity to profit from the information; by the
time most subscribers get the news, it’s already in the price.
Some readers may have noticed a contradiction here. On the one hand,
Fama conceded that returns are “predictable,” at least in the statistical sense,
but on the other, it’s still near-impossible to beat the market. This apparent contradiction is easily resolved. The kinds of predictability statisticians
talk about are very difficult to translate into practical trading advice. Things
that seem “predictable” in retrospect aren’t easy to see in real time. Mortal
traders, who have to worry about commissions, taxes, and other worldly
complications, can’t easily translate an anomaly announced in the Journal of Finance into a profitable trading system. And as soon as news of
the anomaly circulates, a traders would pounce on the opportunity; once
discovered, anomalies can be self-unfulfilling prophecies.
An exception, though, are longer-term anomalies, particularly those
around valuation. Buying undervalued stocks, and avoiding overvalued
ones, might be a way to beat the market over the long term. Here, the
difficulty isn’t so much technical as psychological: it means going against
the consensus, and suffering the scorn of your colleagues. It also means
measuring performance over years, even decades, rather than months and
quarters — impossible for professional portfolio managers, who are under constant short-term review, and difficult even for amateurs, who might
be embarrassed to describe their strange preferences at cocktail parties.
disinformation, noise, fads, and bubbles
Efficient market theory depends on the universal, costless dissemination
of accurate information about economic and corporate prospects. The uncritical stance of most Wall Street analysts and much of the financial press
reviewed in Chapter 2 makes this a bit hard to take just on the grounds of
170

MARKET MODELS

daily evidence. But even if analysts were universally honest and wise,
there would still be serious communications problems between managers
and stockholders. For example, according to Jeremy Stein (1989), something like a prisoners’ dilemma prevails in relations between managers
and the stock market. Even if participants are aware of an upward bias to
earnings estimates, and even if they correct for it, managers still have an
incentive to try to fool the market. If you tell the truth, your accurate estimates will be marked down by a skeptical market. So, it’s entirely rational
for managers to boost profits in the short term, either through accounting
gimmickry or by making only investments with quick paybacks.
If the markets see high costs as bad, and low costs as good, then firms
may shun expensive investments because they will be taken as signs of
managerial incompetence. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, the
stock market rewarded firms announcing write-offs and mass firings — a
bulimic strategy of management — since the cost-cutting was seen as contributing rather quickly to profits. Firms and economies can’t get richer by
starving themselves, but stock market investors can get richer when the
companies they own go hungry — at least in the short term. As for the
long term, well, that’s someone else’s problem the week after next.
Managers facing a market that is famous for its preference for quick
profits today rather than patient long-term growth have little choice but to
do its bidding. Otherwise, their stock will be marked down, and the firm
will be ripe for takeover. Stein cited surveys showing that “U.S. executives
ranked share price increases as their second most important objectives
out of nine choices, ahead of such alternatives as improved product portfolio,22 market share, or company image. In contrast, Japanese executives
ranked share price increases as the least important of the nine objectives.”
This is no mere cultural difference, but a reflection of the contrasting systems under which the two nations’ managers operate.
Stein’s analysis is related to a branch of economics that sprouted during the 1980s from seeds planted in the 1970s — the study of information
asymmetry. Since a party to a transaction can never know if the other is
telling the truth, each has to be at least a little suspicious of the other. But
protective actions resulting from such suspicions may leave both parties
worse off than they would have been had both parties been honest and
trusting. What, for example, does a low price mean? It may mean a real
bargain — but it may also be a hint of damaged goods. (To take an extreme example, an offer of half-price sushi might drive away more customers than it attracts.) A price can convey more than is visible on first
171

WALL STREET

glance. This greatly complicates the mainstream notion of prices as a signaling mechanism for balancing supply and demand; there may be lots of
noise mixed in with the signals.
As they say on Wall Street, when something looks too good to be true,
it probably is. Or as one of the major figures in the development of information asymmetry theory, Joseph Stiglitz, put it, “If it’s such a good idea,
why are you telling me, instead of investing your own money?” (quoted in
Kane 1993). This is a remarkably blunt statement for Stiglitz, whose normal mode is the symbols of pure mathematized theory.
Interest in “information asymmetry” is usually traced to George Akerlof’s
1969 paper on the “lemons” problem — not the fruit, but bum autos. Wouldbe buyers of used cars have no way of knowing whether the vehicle they’re
contemplating is any good. So the price must reflect the possibility that it
is a lemon, meaning that the sellers of good cars get an unfairly low price
— while the sellers of bad ones still get an unfairly high one. If the lemon
discount is deep enough, it may keep the sellers of good cars out of the
market, because they can’t get the price they think they deserve. But since
textbook markets aren’t supposed to work this way, this has to be counted
as a serious flaw, because so many participants, actual or potential, are
dissatisfied with the relation between price and product.
Stilgitz and Andrew Weiss (1981) applied this principle to the credit
markets, arguing, almost entirely in math, that at a given interest rate, lenders will earn lower returns by lending to bad borrowers (because of defaults) than to good borrowers. If lenders try to jack up the interest rate to
compensate for this risk, they may chase away good borrowers, who are
unwilling to pay a higher rate, while perversely not chasing away incompetent, criminal, or malignantly optimistic borrowers. Such a market doesn’t
clear; there will always be unsatisfied players at a given rate of interest.
Stiglitz and his collaborators (Greenwald and Stiglitz 1984; 1987; Stiglitz
1988) argue that informational problems explain credit rationing, which
in turn can explain both the business cycle and unemployment.23
Though economists treat the lemons problem as if it were a recent discovery, it’s really as old as the classics. Adam Smith (1976, Book II, Chapter 4), in recommending a legal ceiling on the rate of interest, observed:
If the legal rate of interest in Great Britain, for example, was fixed so high
as eight or ten percent, the greater part of the money which was to be lent
would be lent to prodigals and projectors, who alone would be willing to
give this high interest. Sober people, who will give for the use of money no

172

MARKET MODELS

more than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it, would not
venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of the country would
thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make a profitable
and advantageous use of it, and thrown into those which were most likely
to waste and destroy it.24

This provides an interesting gloss on the junk bond era. Or, as David Ricardo
(1911/1987, Chapter 21), put it:
To the question, “who would lend money to farmers, manufacturers, and
merchants, at 5 per cent. per annum, when another borrower, having little
credit would give 7 or 8?” I reply, that every prudent or reasonable man
would. Because the rate of interest is 7 or 8 per cent. there where the lender
runs extraordinary risk is this any reason that it should be equally high in
those places where they are secured from such risks?

Michael Perelman, who teaches economics at California State University–Chico, said that when he told Stiglitz about these classic prefigurations of his argument, Stiglitz, regarded as one of the prime theorists of his
field, reacted with surprise. To become a famous economist, you need not
be familiar with the founding documents of your discipline.25 Besides, Smith
and Ricardo used words, words that anyone can understand. It’s much
more serious to use math, which only a handful of people can decode;
even professional economists report Stiglitz’ work hard going.
The stock market is also afflicted with informational problems (Myers
and Majluf 1984; Greenwald, Stiglitz, and Weiss 1984). Outside investors
must decide whether a firm selling fresh equity is legitimately trying to
raise money for a worthy pursuit, or just trying to leave outsiders holding
the bag. Assuming managers know their firm’s prospects better than outsiders, a firm with “overvalued” stock is more likely to issue shares than
one with a low value relative to what managers think of its possibilities, a
very perverse set of incentives. If the markets realize this, then it will be
very difficult to get any deals done. At the extreme, say Greenwald, Stiglitz,
and Weiss, “the ‘effective’ cost of issuing equity may be so high as to be
prohibitive, because any firm that issues equity obtains a ‘bad’ label.” Obviously, firms do issue equity from time to time, but rarely, and mainly in
euphoric bull markets, when suspicions are dulled (though such psychology is uncaptured in the models of Stiglitz & Co.).
In fact, euphoric self-deception seems to be what makes new equity
offerings possible. Several recent studies show convincingly that new stock
173

WALL STREET

offerings — whether by firms issuing stock for the first time (initial public
offerings — IPOs) or by already-public firms issuing fresh helpings of paper (seasoned equity offerings — SEOs) — greatly underperform the general market for years (Loughran and Ritter 1995; Cheng 1996).26
One prominent exception to poor IPO performance is that personally
enjoyed by favored clients of the brokerages who underwrite the offerings. During a hot IPO market, prices typically rise in the early hours and
days of trading, often quite dramatically, yielding quick and fat profits to
those getting first dibs. For especially hot offerings, it can be hard to get a
piece of the action — unless, of course, you have a friendly investment
banker who reserves a fat tranche for you. Best known are the sweet deals
earned by important politicans of both major parties — like former House
Speaker Tom Foley and Senate Banking Committee chair Alfonse D’Amato
(Glassman 1994; Kuntz and Simpson 1996). Even politicians with sterling
reputations play the game; a former Wall Street Journal reporter told me
he had confirmed information that a prestigious Senator beloved of the
pundit class had played the game — but the journalist refused to publish
the info because he was fond of the Senator.
Many rationales have been offered for poor post-offering performance,
including managers’ taking advantage of an “overpriced” stock — confirming the asymmetry theorists’ speculation — and managerial manipulation of reported profits. Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1990) show that
IPOs are far more likely when valuations are high than when average or
low — formal proof of something that observers of Wall Street know in
their bones. Teoh, Welch, and Wong (1995) show that accounting games
played in advance of a stock offering should be visible at the time of the
offering. If analysts were doing their jobs, these manipulations should have
been noticed; but most analysts are in the pay of firms in the business of
selling securities. Creative bookkeeping is a proven marketing tool.27
These problems may be mitigated through the development of longterm relationships between firms and their outside financiers. This is one
of the advantages of bank, as opposed to bond or stock market, finance;
bankers get to know their customers if they’re together for a long time.
But with the markets, the relationship is often the financial equivalent of a
one-night stand; ecstasy is always possible, but so too is mortal disease.
Countries like Japan and Germany that are usually classified as bankcentered — because banks provide more outside finance than markets,
and because more firms have long-term relationships with their banks —
show greater growth in and stability of investment over time than the mar174

MARKET MODELS

ket-centered ones, like the U.S. and Britain. The reason seems to be that
British and U.S. firms are more dependent on their internal funds for financing investment, in contrast with firms in the other countries, where
outside finance is available from a familiar banker. Further, studies comparing German and Japanese firms with tight bank ties to those without
them also show that firms with bank ties exhibit greater stability in investment over the business cycle (Corbett and Jenkinson 1993; Elston 1994).
It became fashionable in the mid-1990s to celebrate the American stockmarket model as vindicated by the weak performance of the Japanese
and German economies during the Clinton years. While it’s not clear
whether that U.S. outperformance is a permanent thing or just a shorterterm cyclical affair, it can’t be denied that the old Axis powers experienced extraordinary growth in investment and income during the first 45
years after World War II’s end. It may be that as capitalist economies mature, and liquid balances swell, they may tend toward a more fluid style of
finance and ownership.

irrational expectations
Information asymmetry theorists generally assume that market participants
are the rational self-maximizers of mainstream theory; they can just never
be certain of the knowledge and motives of their counterparts. As Robert
Gordon said of the closely related New Keynesian school, “any attempt to
build a model based on irrational behavior or submaximizing behavior is
viewed as cheating” (quoted in Dymski 1994).
While it’s safe to believe that financial players are self-maximizers, their
rationality is another matter. Academic students of finance have increasingly recognized that lots of old-fashioned impressionistic notions about
market volatility may be truer than rationalists could imagine. The notion
that fads and bubbles and panics drive security prices far from their fundamental value — deviations that end not by returning to that fundamental value but typically by overshooting it to the other extreme — now
enjoys a scholarly respectability that it didn’t 15 or 20 years ago.
In an influential series of papers published during the 1980s, Robert
Shiller developed a theory of financial market volatility powered by horde
psychology. His 1981 paper, “Do stock prices move too much to be justified by subsequent changes in dividends?” (reprinted in Shiller 1991) took
aim at the EMH’s claim that stock prices are the rational discounted present
value of rationally anticipated future dividends or profits. On the second
page of his article, Shiller charted the value of stock prices against the
175

WALL STREET

“true” value a perfectly rational market should have been assigning stocks
based on how dividends actually turned out (a highly defensible use of
20/20 hindsight) from 1871–1979.28 The line representing dividends is remarkably stable, even through the Great Depression, but the line representing stock prices zigs and zags wildly, remaining at extremes of overand under-valuation for years, even decades.
Another perspective on the market’s labile temperament is the “volatility paradox,” the enormous variations in volatility in stock prices (Shiller
1988; Schwert 1989). This volatility bears no statistical relation to the volatility of real-world phenomena like inflation, money growth, industrial
production, interest rates, or business failures.29 Moreover, despite the
advent of computerized trading techniques such as portfolio insurance
and index arbitrage during the 1980s, day-to-day volatility during that decade was little different from that of the 1970s, though both decades were
more volatile than the 1950s and 1960s (Davis and White 1987).
Schwert’s data report stock volatility to have been low during times of
great economic distress, like wars or the extended depression of the late
19th century, suggesting that in times of real social stress, people have
more important things to worry about than their portfolios. That speculation, however, is upended by the fact that volatility during the Great Depression of the 1930s was the most extreme in financial history, far
outpacing the increase in real-world volatility. Schwert finds only “weak”
evidence that real-world (industrial production) volatility presages future
financial volatility, and “somewhat stronger” evidence that financial volatility presages the real-world kind, but much of the time, it seems, the
stock market dances to its own tune.
Why? Shiller (1984) points to various social phenomena to explain these
departures from rationality. Efficient market enthusiasts deny any role to
mass psychology; if, as they believe, markets are unforecastable, there’s
no room for psychological explanations of price behavior. Shiller dismisses
this as “one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic
thought.” Investing is a social activity: both amateur and professional investors spend lots of time gossiping, researching, and comparing performance. Financial markets are not the sum of the rational expectations of
reasoning investors, but the collective judgment of a mob.
There is good evidence from experimental psychology showing that
real people don’t act in accordance with the assumptions of most financial
models (cited in de Bondt and Thaler 1985; Kahneman and Tversky 1979).
Specifically, people tend to overweight new information, rather than av176

MARKET MODELS

eraging it into a historical context. De Bondt and Thaler were able to use
this information to predict stock prices: a portfolio composed of a broad
array of “losers” — stocks that had been mercilessly beaten down by the
market — outperformed the averages over the subsequent three years. In
other words, the initial losses were the result of overreactions that corrected themselves, but not without the passage of quite a bit of time.30
In a series of papers, Lawrence Summers and his colleagues (Cutler et
al. 1989; Cutler et al. 1990; Cutler et al. 1991; Poterba and Summers 1986;
Poterba and Summers 1988; Summers 1986; these are clearly recounted in
Shleifer and Summers 1990) developed “the noise trader approach to finance.” In the words of Shleifer and Summers:
Our approach rests on two assumptions. First, some investors are not fully
rational and their demand for risky assets is affected by their beliefs or sentiments that are not fully justified by fundamental news. Second, arbitrage
— defined as trading by fully rational investors not subject to such sentiment — is risky and therefore limited. The two assumptions together imply
that changes in investor sentiment are not fully countered by arbitrageurs
and so affect security returns.

Arbitrage in this sense refers to the efficient marketeers’ assumption
that should prices get out of line with their warranted value, rational investors will move in quickly and buy underpriced assets or sell overpriced
ones. Thus mispricing can only be transient, never sustained. This makes
sense if you’re dealing with two very similar assets; were gold is selling for
$350 an ounce in New York and $355 in London, then speculators would
immediately move in and buy New York and sell London. But what if the
whole U.S. stock market seems overpriced to a rational arbitrageur? What
can she buy and sell to drive prices back into line? What about the danger
that overpriced stocks may get even more overpriced before returning to
a more “rational” value? How does the arb know what the rational price
really is? What if profits are about to take off, and the apparently irrational
value isn’t so wacky after all? And what about the fact that a short-seller
has to cover the dividends on the stock sold short (to the stockholder the
shares were borrowed from); this isn’t costless either.
While markets may be populated by the rational souls assumed by
theory, as anyone familiar with the trade knows, they’re also populated
with a few less than perfectly rational souls as well. The irrationals trade
on “noise” as well as information — pseudo-information (Black 1986).
Were noise traders all truly listening to sounds of their own devising, they
177

WALL STREET

might cancel each other out, but instead “judgment biases afflicting investors in processing information tend to be the same. Subjects in psychological experiments tend to make the same mistake; they do not make
random mistakes” (Shleifer and Summers 1990). In such experiments, subjects tend to be overconfident, which makes them take on more risk than
they should; they tend to extrapolate the past into the future, which leads
them to chase (sometimes spurious) trends; and they give too much weight
to new information, at the expense of what they already knew.31
Technical traders — people who spot patterns like breakouts and breakdowns on price charts — spread noise. They frequently buy stocks that
appear to be in strong uptrends, or sell those that have “violated” some
perceived level of support. While these “signals” are almost certainly meaningless in the long term, they can be self-fulfilling in the short term.
Noise traders and faddists are the culprits in a market pattern called
“mean reversion.” In the short term, their trading strategies push prices
further than they might have gone in a fully rational world, whatever that
is, but when the prices get too far away, the bubble bursts, and prices
revert to some fundamental value. But noise operates on the corrective
side too, meaning that prices overshoot their target, which sets up another
reversion. The statistics offered by Cutler, Poterba, Summers, & Co. are, as
Fama noted, a “power failure” — the patterns they spot, while significant
in the statistical sense, are less than overwhelmingly so.
But his own work with his Chicago colleague Kenneth French (Fama
and French 1988) does offer long-term support to the pattern of mean
reversion, specifically a three- to five-year timespan. Surveying stock prices
over the 60-year period from 1926 to 1985, Fama and French argued that
mean reversion accounts for about 35% of the behavior of stock prices.
Though the tendency is strongest among the stocks of smaller firms, it
holds for large stocks, across 17 industry groups, and among even the
relative handful of individual stocks that survived the entire 1926–85 period. Fama and French quite reasonably offered no practical advice to
speculators on what this all means; describing a tendency that operates
broadly over the course of years isn’t much help to traders whose idea of
the long term is the day after tomorrow.
It is, however, of considerable economic interest. The two Chicagoans
argue that this behavior is not necessarily testimony in support of the irrationality of financial markets. External “shocks” can encourage departures
from rational evaluations of future returns. This is a favorite ploy of freemarket theoreticians: instability must be seen as external to the market
178

MARKET MODELS

system, not inherent in it. But it does violence to language to call such
regular, predictable features of the market system “external shocks.”
Shiller, Summers, and the rest are onto something of more than statistical interest. But they don’t draw some of the more interesting conclusions
their work suggests. Shiller, who has probably done more than any single
economist to damage EM theory, devoted a whole book (Shiller 1993) to
playing with the idea of establishing futures markets so that businesses
and people could hedge themselves against “macro” risks like big moves
in GDP or house prices. No one, not even the biggest firm, is exposed to
direct risk from GDP growth, and the practical problems in trading futures
on a number that is revised frequently — twice in the months after its
initial release, again in annual revisions, and yet again in periodic benchmark revisions — don’t enter Shiller’s mind.32
Why might an economist so prominently associated with the notion of
excess volatility promote the development of new futures markets? Oh,
convention has the perfect answer for this — a variation on Bill Clinton’s
favorite maxim, that what’s wrong with America can be cured by what’s
right with America. That is, markets are volatile because markets are “incomplete” — if there were markets in absolutely everything, if every risk
of life could be hedged with a futures contract, from the possibility of
snow tomorrow to that of leukemia at age 60, then excess volatility would
disappear, and rationality and placidity would reign.
Summers’ academic work seemed to have no influence in his performance as the chief economist at the World Bank and later as the Clinton
Treasury Department’s top international official.33 He was at the Bank when
stock markets were heavily promoted as instruments of Third World development. Nor has he had any apparent influence on Clinton’s financial
policies; probably no Democratic president has been so in thrall to Wall
Street. And Joseph Stiglitz, as a member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors and chief economist of the World Bank, has had little to
say about what his research means for the real world.34
the marketeers defend themselves
Many of the architects of financial theory continued to defend their
progeny’s real world effects in the 1980s. In a speech reprinted in the Wall
Street Journal, Harry Markowitz (1991), one of the creators of modern
portfolio theory and CAPM, predictably summoned Adam Smith to defend program trading, Salomon Brothers’ mortgage-backed bond depart179

WALL STREET

ment, and junk bond finance: “My own view is that the invisible hand
could work its magic through mere humans is an essential part of Adam
Smith’s insight. Not many thousands of years ago, men like this would
have clubbed each other over hunting rights. A few hundreds of years ago
they would have hacked each other with axes and swords. Now they yelled
at trainees while they brought together the supply and demand of [sic]
home mortgages on a world-wide scale.”
Through mere humans? Smith, a man of his time, saw the invisible hand
as attached to God’s invisible arm; are we to believe that Milken & Co.
were divine agents? Has modern finance really made war obsolete?
And what about this sublime matchmaking that Salomon Brothers was
allegedly performing in the mortgage markets? Markowitz was reacting in
part to the book Liar’s Poker, Michael Lewis’ story of his short, intense,
and comical life as an investment banker at Salomon Brothers in the late
1980s, an environment rich in gluttony and crudeness. Markowitz apparently overlooked Lewis’ descriptions of how Salomon’s traders bought
mortgages from failing savings and loans, repackaged them into bonds,
and sold them back to the thrifts at enormous profit to themselves and
huge losses to the S&Ls — and eventually, U.S. taxpayers.35 Deregulated
and doomed, they were eager to play games on Wall Street.
Here is Lewis’ (1989a, p. 105) description of the miraculous Smithian
pricing mechanism at work:
Trader Tom DiNapoli fondly remembers a call from one thrift president.
“He wanted to sell a hundred million dollars’ worth of his thirty-year loans
…and buy a hundred million dollars of some other loans with the cash
from the sale. I told him I’d bid [buy] his loans at seventy-five [cents on the
dollar] and offer him the others at eighty-five.” The thrift president scratched
his head at the numbers. He was selling loans nearly identical to those he
was buying, but the difference in yield would leave him out of pocket an
unheard-of ten million dollars. Or, to put it another way, the thrift was being asked to pay a transaction fee of ten million dollars to Salomon Brothers. “That doesn’t sound like a very good trade to me,” he said. DiNapoli
was ready for that one. “It isn’t, from an economic point of view,” he said,
“but look at it this way, if you don’t do it, you’re out of a job.” A fellow
trader talking to another thrift president on another line overheard DiNapoli
and cracked up. It was the funniest thing he had heard all day. He could
picture the man on the other end of the phone, just oozing desperation.

Elsewhere, Lewis recalled some of the language his colleagues had used
180

MARKET MODELS

to hoodwink thrift executives, phrases like “risk-controlled arbitrage” and
“CMO equity.” The first, Lewis said, was a fashionable mid-1980s
“euphemism…for big-time gambling in the mortgage bond market,” and
the second, a 1987 invention, was “a particularly slippery mortgage investment. The CMO stands for collateralized mortgage obligation, but bond
salesmen call it ‘toxic waste.’”36 The language of portfolio theorists had
become an elegant disguise for hucksters.
Markowitz argued accurately that the days of DiNapoli’s 10-point, $10
million bid–ask spreads could not last; imitators quickly poached on
Salomon’s turf, ending the days of their monopoly profits. But how well
did this mortgage market work even after competition had shaved down
the point spreads to more reasonable levels? The 1980s were the first decade since the Depression during which homeownership rates fell — partly
a function of declining real wages, for sure, but also a result of continued
inflation in the cost of housing. It was also a time when mass homelessness
became a permanent feature of the national landscape. And it was also a
time when the ratio of home mortgages to the value of their underlying
owner-occupied properties went from 28% in 1980 to 43% in 1990.37
The ideologists of the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page could not
resist appending their own commentary to Markowitz’ lecture, or more
accurately, to lift some reasoning from another Nobelist’s prize lecture,
that of Merton Miller (1991). Miller began his address by denying that he,
along with Modigliani, was the “co-inventor of the leveraged buyout —
the transaction that perhaps more than any other has come to symbolize
the financial excesses of the 1980s.” Miller argued, accurately, that LBOs
— specifically those in which “younger, active managers of a firm borrowed the funds to buy the controlling shares from a firm’s retired founder
(or from his estate)” — were around long before the first MM paper. “The
LBO’s of the 1980s differed only in scale, in that they involved publiclyheld rather than privately-held corporations and in that the takeovers were
often hostile.” He might have added that interest rates were a lot lower in
1958 than they were in 1985. Miller conceded these points only to dismiss
them, since they are enormously different from the often sensible transactions consummated before, say, 1984.
Miller also argued, again accurately, that it is ironic that he and Modigliani
are credited as the theorists of LBOs, “since the central message of our
M&M Propositions was that the value of the firm was independent of its
capital structure” (aside from the tax correction of 1963). Miller insisted
again that the MM propositions are the “finance equivalents of conserva181

WALL STREET

tion laws” since a firm’s risk depends on the profits from its real assets, not
its financial structure: “leveraging or deleveraging…serves merely to partition that risk among the firm’s security holders.” In fact, wrote Miller, the
real “gains in value achieved in the LBO’s of the 1980s lies, in fact, not in
our newly-recognized field of finance at all,” but in the tremendous efficiency gains engineered by “LBO entrepreneurs,” a title even more inflated than Alan Greenspan’s “unaffiliated corporate restructurers.”38 Those
gains, as we’ll see in a moment, are figments of Miller’s busy imagination.
Miller has lately been renting himsef out as an expert witness at the
undoubtedly high fees a Nobel laureate can command. His paid testimony,
however, is hardly of prizewinning quality. The Nasdaq hired Miller and
several Chicago comrades, who collectively trade under the name Lexecon
Inc., to show that its strange pricing practices (discussed in Chapter 1)
were not evidence of market-maker collusion, but a simple manifestation
of the tendency of prices to cluster around magic numbers like quarters
and halves rather than eighths (Lexecon Inc. 1995). Why the NYSE does
not exhibit this strange clustering was not well-explained; Miller & Co.
simply found other markets that exhibited similar clustering.39 Of course,
Lexecon could not have anticipated that Nasdaq clustering would decline
once the phenomenon was publicized, and legal action loomed. Nor could
it have imagined conversations like the one quoted in Chapter 1 of this
book, climaxing in the lovely line, “I’m goosing it, cuz.”
A year later, Merrill Lynch hired Miller and Lexecon in an attempt to
defend itself against a lawsuit by Orange County, California, in which the
county accused the broker of selling it some bad derivatives that drove it
into bankruptcy. In their report, the hired guns (Lexecon Inc. 1996) argued that had the county not liquidated its portfolio, and toughed it out
instead, it would have emerged whole. Lexecon didn’t mention the fact
that long-term interest rates fell nearly two points over the term of the
study; had they risen, the county would have been even deeper under
water. In a letter to the Wall Street Journal, a lawyer for Orange County
(Bennett 1996) pointed out that the firm didn’t bother to submit Miller’s
paper as evidence, because the firm was “rightly concerned that its hired
professor could not withstand cross-examination if he were to appear in
court.”40 Merrill’s claims were dismissed by the bankruptcy court.
Back to the Nobelist, and his case for leverage. When Miller spoke of
gains in value, he meant the huge interest flows and stock market gains of
the period. From 1982, the beginning of the great bull market, until 1989,
the end of the LBO era, the market value of nonfinancial corporations’
182

MARKET MODELS

stock rose $1.83 trillion (from $1.38 trillion to $3.21 trillion), and the value
of corporate bonds oustanding rose $519.1 billion (from $407.0 billion to
$926.1 billion). But while stocks rose 133%, and bonds, 128% (and, of
course, most of the gain in bonds was the result of new issues, not capital
gains on old ones), business sector productivity rose 12.6%, and the broadest productivity measure of all, real GDP per hour worked throughout the
entire economy (including the government and nonprofit sectors), rose
6.3% — quite weak by historical standards.
That great LBO boom suggests more interesting analytical territory, away
from flows and valuations and towards what might be called the politics
of money — the ownership and control of corporations and the exercise
of power over governments.
notes
1. A quick way of drawing the distinction is that finance refers to claims exercised over
time, like debts, and that money is the instrument in which such claims are settled. This
distinction gets wobbly as soon as you push on it; a Treasury bill is a debt, but most
creditors would be happy to receive one to settle a claim. T-bills, then, are a form of
near-money. More on this later.
2. And traders trade on these models. There’s evidence that new markets gravitate toward
prices dictated by models that are later discovered to be inappropriate to their markets
(Cherian and Jarrow 1993; Thomas 1995). In the case of the Value Line stock index
futures contract, traders systematically mispriced the index for its first four years of
trading, 1982 to 1986; they didn’t understand that standard pricing formulas didn’t apply to an index determined by geometric rather than arithmetic averages. Pricing may
have been “efficient,” but it was wrong — wrong, that is, according to the “right” model.
3. Over the last decade or two, radical economists — who now often call themselves
heterodox, a far less confrontational term — have gone from criticizing this hypermathematical turn in the discipline to trying to outdo their mainstream colleagues at
the game. They seem to think that building a better model will persuade the mainstreamers of the errors of their ways.
4. Of course they were asking these questions on behalf of money managers, who need
advice on how to handle the trillions of dollars they “run.”
5. Besides comfortable self-sufficiency, one shouldn’t discount the macho feel of having
dominated chaos with a complex model.
6. In a prisoners’ dilemma, two experimental subjects, metaphorically partners in crime,
are given the choice of betraying each other or hanging tough for monetary reward. If
one defects and the other doesn’t, the skunk gets 3 units. If both defect, each gets 1. If
both cooperate, each gets 2.
7. One doesn’t want to get too carried away naturalizing temperament and values, but the
model seems particularly to drive away women and nonwhites, at least in America,
because of its chilly irreality. It may just be that sex and race are simply convenient
markers for hierarchy —that economics is an ideology of privilege, and the already
privileged, or those who wish to become apologists for the privileged, are drawn to its
study.

8. Correlation coefficients for the various versions of q suggested in the text are all well
over .92. The correlation for the simple equity q (market value of stock divided by
tangible assets, as shown in the charts and used in the text) and the values for 1960–74
reported in Tobin and Brainard (1977) is .97.
9. It’s interesting that investment rose during what are usually considered the bad years of
the 1970s. It may be that the rise in oil prices devalued old, energy-inefficient equipment, forcing firms to invest more than they would have otherwise. Most analysts, left
and right, regard high investment as a good thing, but not so owners and their theorists. The “excessive” investment of the 1970s was taken care of by the shareholder
revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s, which in part was designed to shift corporate profits out of real investment and into Wall Street hands, mainly through interest and capital gains on takeovers.
10. Specifically, they regressed changes in investment on changes in cash flow, sales, and
stock valuations, allowing the fundamentals to enter the regressions first, and then
adding in the stock measures. At the firm level, fundamentals explained 21% of the
variation in investment (i.e., the r2 was .208); adding in stock values improved the
explanatory power to 25% (r2 = .246), meaning that the stock market added less than 4
percentage points to their equations’ power — in other words, very little. The “incremental r2,” in the jargon, was even lower for small firms and lower still for the market
and economy as a whole.
11. Cost of capital is the phrase MM use; it equals profits divided by the market value of all
outstanding securities, debt and equity. This is the cost of capital from the issuing firm’s
point of view; outside investors might think of it as the return on their invested capital.
12. Fazzari et al. point out that investment tax credits, by reducing the cost of new investment, are not of much help to constrained firms; they would be better off with lower
average tax rates, which would increase their cash flow, most of which would likely be
invested.
13. All figures in the previous two paragraphs are from Bernanke (1983), except total bank
failures, which is from U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, p. 1038, and aggregate corporate profits, from the national income accounts.
14. Fisher is perhaps most famous for his ill-timed observation, made only days before the
1929 crash, that “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau” (quoted in Galbraith 1988, p. 70). Perhaps, then, his view of the collapse having
no end should be regarded skeptically. But his analysis of the debt deflation process
seems entirely sound.
15. Even though the U.S. economy entered its fifth year of expansion in the spring of 1996,
the GDP growth rate was the slowest of any business cycle upswing since the end of
World War II.
16. Interest here is measured against EBIT — or earnings (profits) before interest and taxes;
a firm with $100 in pretax profits, and $50 in interest payments, has an interest burden
of 33% of EBIT [(50/(100+50)=33%].
17. All figures are from the flow of funds accounts.
18. Hereafter, EM refers to efficient markets, and the EMH to the efficient markets hypothesis.
19. Though Chicago is the Vatican of free-market theory, Fama himself is an admirably fairminded scholar, not shy about publicly changing his mind. But the kind of company he
kept is telling. Among those Fama acknowledges at the outset of this paper are Arthur
Laffer, who became famous for the preposterous curve he allegedly drew on a cocktail
napkin that “proved” that a government could increase its revenue by cutting tax rates,
and Michael Jensen, who was one of the intellectual godfathers of the 1980s, discussed
below.

20. Though most EM theory is based on the stock market, it can be applied to the analysis
of other financial asset prices as well. “Stock,” in a sentence like this, is a stand-in for
the whole array of instruments.
21. The debate over CAPM seems to be not without political aspects. For example, the
defense by Kothari et al. (1995) was funded by the Olin Foundation and circulated by
the Bradley Policy Research Center of the William E. Simon School of Business at the
University of Rochester; Bradley and Olin are right-wing foundations, and Simon, besides being a financier, is a right-wing political figure who is famous for promoting
right-wing philanthropy. Asked by email to comment, S.P. Kothari found the idea of
political influence “amusing” and Jay Shanken said his “first reaction [was] to laugh.”
Shanken added: “if I were the type who is politically influenced, I would probably lie
in response to your question,” raising specters of the “all Cretans are liars” braintwister.
22. Not “improved products,” note; the language of the financial markets seems to have
captured even this critic of its influence.
23. Troubled firms, for example, could offer “contingent equity-like wage offers” — i.e.,
we’ll pay you if we don’t go belly up first — to unemployed workers; “but since the
firms most likely to offer these contracts (e.g., Eastern Airlines) are just the firms from
whom workers do not want to accept them, such arrangements are difficult to make”
(Greenwald and Stiglitz 1987). Neat idea; too bad it’s impossible.
24. Leave it to the ancient to be concerned more about the social good than the modern,
who worries mainly about the mathematics of market clearance and the risk to creditors.
25. Some even celebrate this forgetfulness. Techno-Marxoid John Roemer, author of a preposterous scheme for stock market socialism (Roemer 1994), says frequently in conversation that to progress, a discipline must forget its founders.
26. Cheng also found that the stocks of bond issuers do not underperform the market,
suggesting among other things that turning outside for finance isn’t the crucial issue,
but that the form it takes — debt or equity — does matter.
27. The findings about stock offerings smack of planned deception on the part of seller
and broker, and even self-deception on the part of the buyer; pure info asymmetry
theorists don’t really have room for enthusiasts or liars in their models.
28. To be precise, Shiller “detrended” stock prices and profits, that is, he looked only at
their departure from their long-term growth trend line. Econometric techniques often
require detrended data, and it makes intuitive sense to scrutinize the stock market’s
skill at separating the ordinary from the extraordinary — the short- to medium-term
oscillations around a long-term trend.
29. Shiller delivered his 1988 paper at a conference dominated by memories of the October 1987 stock market crash, an event that should have doomed all notions of market
efficiency for good. What rational event could have justified the overnight markdown
of world equity values by $1 trillion? Shiller was buoyed by his own survey of money
managers showing that no news event prompted the debacle; 90% claimed to have
thought the market overvalued prior to the crash, but it took the sight of the Dow
falling several hundred points to get them to sell.
30. This confirms the earlier observation that the psychologically difficult strategy of “value”
investing makes good economic sense.
31. In surveys of portfolio managers and housebuyers, Shiller (1990) discovered that both
groups, the former supposedly sophisticated and the latter not, subscribe to extremely
simple theories of market dynamics. The findings boil down to this: people, sophisticated or not, tend to follow the crowd. A survey of London fund managers (Taylor
1988) showed that these presumed rational traders of EM theory did a pretty mediocre
job of forecasting critical economic variables — not completely awful, but not conso185

nant with rational expectations theory.
32. Shiller is a partner in a firm, Case Shiller Weiss, that computes and distributes regional
house prices for a fee.
33. When he was still an academic, Summers did not like it that his paper tentatively promoting a transactions tax on securities to discourage pointless trading was going to be
quoted in an editorial in The Nation; the editorial used his numbers, but was stripped
of his timorous endorsement (Nation 1989).
34. Though I was dying to ask him what the policy implications of his work were, Stiglitz’s
office failed to respond to several requests for an interview.
35. Hijinks like these are why Jonathan Gray, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein,
estimates that as much as a third of Wall Street’s revenues between 1983 and 1987 —
the heart of the Roaring Eighties — came from the thrifts. Aside from the mortgage
chicanery, Wall Street firms also deposited their clients’ funds with hotshot thrifts, who
would then turn around and buy the (often dubious) securities the firms were peddling
(Mayer 1990, pp. 296–297). Of course, the U.S. Treasury ultimately picked up the tab
for this exercise in market efficiency.

stocks with wide bid–ask spreads that subsequently shifted to the NYSE showed significant declines in the spread on exchange listing.

Renegades

In a better world, talk of noise, fads, imperfect knowledge, and emotional
overreaction would have traveled beyond the arena of financial economics to the realm where political judgments are made. But such a passage
might be inconvenient to the current mood of capitalist triumphalism.
So it’s unsurprising that mainstream economists have been reluctant to
draw too many theoretical conclusions from these empirical discoveries.
Had they done so, it might give a lift to the reputation of an economist
now regarded as unfashionable, John Maynard Keynes. The more interesting, and radical, aspects of Keynes’s writing were forgotten in the years
just after World War II, when his analysis of capitalism’s tendencies towards polarization and volatility was domesticated into a banal strategy of
business cycle management. The few modern economists who have developed those strains of Keynesian thought are marginalized by the discipline — especially those who mix Keynes with Marx.
For Keynes, the financial markets aren’t neutral and efficient allocators
of capital or the friends of social development, but rather irrational, destabilizing, and paradoxically conservative institutions that do more to expand rentier wealth than they do to nourish a broad and secure prosperity.
Since, in his view, investment in real assets is the driving force of capitalist
economies, and since the level and allocation of real investment depends
heavily on the state of the financial markets, material progress is hostage
to the whimsical forces of finance.
facts on the ground
Perhaps the best place to start this off-road tour is by exploring a fundamental social fact that efficient market theorists and Modigliani–Miller
partisans have tried to finesse: financial investment and real investment
187

WALL STREET

are distinct activities undertaken “by different sets of people influenced
by different sets of motives, each not paying very much attention to the
other” (Keynes, CW V, p. 250).1
Capitalism was not always such. During the early days of the industrial
revolution, firms were run by individuals, families, or a small circle of
partners who reinvested their profits in the business. But with persistent
growth and increasing technological complexity, this simple structure
became untenable. For example, New England mill owners of the early
19th century found that their profits, as fat as they were, weren’t sufficient
to cover the financing needs of a rapidly growing and changing industry.
Equipment had to be bought and maintained, and workers, previously
paid irregularly in goods, had to be paid regularly in money, or they would
starve. (Subsistence agriculture was no longer an option for urban workers.) So mill owners incorporated their enterprises — selling ownership
shares to outsiders — in order to tap the surplus wealth of rich Boston
merchants. Yet even then, the ownership circle was rather small; controlling shares in a typical Massachusetts mill were typically held by three or
four close associates and their families (Chandler 1977, pp. 58–60).
Such financing and ownership structures were too intimate to cope
with the railroad. Early lines first turned to farmers, merchants, and manufacturers living along the proposed route and to European money markets. But by the late 1840s, railroad builders began turning to Wall Street;
just a decade later, all the instruments of modern finance — bonds, stocks,
and even options — were well-established in the U.S., thanks to the railroads’ hunger for capital (Chandler 1977, pp. 91–92).
The bounds of space and personal acquaintance had been broken. With
these innovations came a whole set of institutions: the large national corporation, wage labor, professional management and sophisticated financial markets, institutions that evolved together as the 19th century
progressed. In fact, these are all sides of the same coin — an appropriate
metaphor, since the link among them all is money.
With the separation of savings and investment — and with it the separation of ownership and control — came the possibility of imbalances
between the two. Keynes made much of this potential for dissonance in
his Treatise on Money, a sprawling, two-volume work that preceded his
General Theory by six years. Though the later volume rendered a good bit
of the Treatise’s theorizing obsolete, and though the earlier volume is
largely forgotten except by Keynes cultists, it does include lots of useful
schemas for thinking about an economy.

Talk of savings being unequal to investment sounds heretical and bizarre to modern ears. As defined by national income accountants, the two
must always be in balance. In every issue of the U.S. Department of
Commerce’s flagship statistical publication, the Survey of Current Business,
there appears NIPA table 5.1, “Gross Saving and Investment.” The figures
for 1995 are reproduced, with a bit of editing, in the nearby table.

of dividends, depreciation allowances, and the government deficit — must
equal gross investment, which comprises business investment in buildings, machinery, and inventories; personal investment in housing; and
acquisitions of foreign assets by U.S. residents less acquisitions of U.S.
assets by foreigners. In even simpler English, income that isn’t spent on
consumption must be invested (leaving aside, of course, that which is
stuffed into mattresses or lost down manholes). If savings are defined simply as income that isn’t spent on consumption, and total production consists only of consumption and investment goods (a simplification, but not
a violent one), then savings must equal investment, since consumption
expenditures must equal the total sales of consumption goods. Voilà, savings = investment; otherwise, where would the money go? Or as Keynes
189

WALL STREET

said, “Savings and investment are merely alternative names for the difference between income and consumption” (CW XIII, p. 552).
In practical terms, savings and investment are balanced through changes
in inventories, $37 billion of which are included in the investment figures
in the table. In good times, or in anticipation of good times, firms increase
production beyond demand to build inventories; in bad times, sales fall
more quickly than production (since firms are producing according to
recent demand), leading to a buildup in inventory. The first is planned,
the second, unplanned. In 1974, for example, the belly of the 1973–75
recession, inventory buildup was 9% of gross nonresidential investment.
Inventories were reduced in 1975, a form of disinvestment, as managers
throttled back production and investment plans in the wake of 1974’s disappointments. Fixed investment was also cut back. But the recovery that
took hold in the latter part of 1975 drove sales above expectations, resulting in a voluntary accumulation of inventories in the following year — up
by an amount equal to 9% gross nonresidential investment, and 37% of
net, in 1976. Fixed investment perked up as well.
Life is never as neat as all that. The national income and product accounts, as their name implies, consist of two halves, mirror images of each
other.2 In business accounting, the halves are often referred to as sources
and uses of funds; more colloquially, we could call them income and outgo.
Government accountants estimate the two sides of the ledger, totaling income (wages, profits, etc.) and expenditures (consumption, physical investments, etc.) separately. In theory, the two counts should match —
while not every product that is made can be sold, every sale must have a
corresponding purchase. But in practice, they don’t quite even up; in a
$7+ trillion economy, it’s not surprising that the sums don’t work out to
the penny. That mismatch is shown as the statistical discrepancy, which
was negligible in 1995, but can run into eleven figures. And since personal saving cannot be measured directly, but only estimated as the difference between total income and spending, all these numbers should be
considered as no more than a well-educated guess.
But let’s give the national income accountants the benefit of the doubt
and assume these estimates to be roughly correct, and that savings must
equal investment by their definition. Put this way, however, the equivalence of savings and investment is on a par with saying 2+2=4 — accurate,
useful, but not very interesting. Keynes’s analysis in the Treatise, where
he makes the inequality of savings and investment an important motor of
economic change, is of far greater interest.
190

RENEGADES

In the Treatise, Keynes battled one orthodoxy, the quantity theory of
money, with another orthodoxy, the relation between “natural” and market rates of interest. The quantity theory of money, the root of modern
monetarism, starts with an economic truism and ends in a religion. Though
there are several variants, the most famous version of the truism is:
MV=PT.
That is, in one period, typically a year, the amount of money in circulation (M) times its velocity of turnover (V, or the number of times these
units of money are spent) equals the sum of the prices (P) times the number of transactions (T). In practice, some definition of the money supply is
substituted for M, GDP substituted for PT, and since velocity can’t be seen,
it’s assumed to be whatever number makes the equation balance.
Of course, the equation is always true after the fact. But it fails to explain why the variables take on the values they do. They usually bob about
wildly, often with little relation to the others. In the U.S., there are four
official definitions of money, ranging from a narrow one called M1, basically currency plus checking accounts, to a very broad one, called M4 or L
(for liquidity) which includes Treasury bills and other short-term securities. Each marches to its own drumbeat. Velocity is a slippery concept;
monetarists assume it to be constant, but it isn’t — in fact, it’s all over the
place. Speed of turnover is one of the fundamental variables of capitalist
economies, but quantity theory has little to say about it. In the monetarists’ view, changes in M cause changes in prices and volume of production; cause runs only from left to right in the basic quantity equation and
since V is assumed to be a constant, it’s ignored. Though modern monetarists, from Milton Friedman to Alan Greenspan’s Fed staff, have tried to
give their doctrine a dynamic spin, it’s a flat, static, and trivializing view of
a multidimensional, dynamic, and complex system.
Keynes’s Treatise
In a considerable advance on static monetarism, Keynes began his modelbuilding by separating a community’s income into two parts, that earned
in the production of consumer goods, and that in the production of investment goods, and separating its expenditures also into two parts, that
spent on consumption goods and that on savings. This both rejects the
homogeneity of the monetarists’ T, and moves away from static identities
towards a dynamic system.
191

WALL STREET

Consumption goods prices, Keynes posited, were determined jointly
by what are now called unit labor costs — wages per unit of output, or
money wages adjusted for productivity — and the difference between
savings and investment. Or, more precisely, changes in prices are caused
by changes in the other two terms. The other motor of the model is the
relation between savings and investment; changes in the relations between
these two also motivate changes in the broad economy.
Changes in unit labor costs are important to price determination, and
this relation is at the heart of Keynesian and post-Keynesian theories of
inflation.3 Empirically, the correlation between consumer price inflation
and unit labor costs in the U.S. is very tight. If wage growth exceeds productivity growth, producers’ costs will rise, and they will raise prices in
compensation if they can get away with it. If these producers can’t pass
along price increases, they obviously will be forced to take other actions,
ranging from mechanization to union-busting and moves overseas, to preserve profit margins.
More relevant to our terrain is the second relation, the (im)balance between savings and investment, which can generate deficient or excessive
demand for consumption goods. If investment exceeds savings, fresh demand for investment goods will raise wages among workers in the capital
goods industries without there being any offsetting decrease in consumption demand elsewhere (since a decline in consumption would be the
obverse of an increase in savings). The prices of consumption goods will
rise, and the value of money will decline. Conversely, should savings increase faster than investment, the decline in consumption demand would
not be offset by any increase in capital goods demand (which would, in
turn, raise consumption demand); therefore, the price of consumption
goods would decline, and their producers would suffer losses.
Prices are “upset by the fact that the division of the output between
investment and goods for consumption is not necessarily the same as the
division of the income between savings and expenditure on consumption.” And entrepreneurs are deciding independently what quantities of
consumption and investment goods to produce (CW V, p. 121–123).
Financial markets are dominated by two forces — savers’ willingness
to part with cash to buy “securities” (or the choice between “hoarding”
and “investing”) and the generosity of the banking system. If “the public”
— a City and Wall Street euphemism for rich people and investment managers — is bearish, anxious about the future, it will hold cash rather than
making long-term investments. Unless the banking system eases credit to
192

RENEGADES

offset that bearishness, new investment will be choked. Price levels overall depend, then, on the savings rate, the cost of new investment, the bearishness of the public, and the volume of savings deposits — a formula that
boils down to the excess of saving over the cost of investment, and the
disparity between the bearishness of the public and the offsetting looseness of the banking system (or bullishness and tightness).
Investment and savings, then, often conflated in mainstream theory,
are quite different things that nonetheless are expected to balance. Investment, in Keynes’s words, is “the positive act of starting or maintaining
some process of production or of withholding liquid goods. It is measured by the net addition to wealth whether in the form of fixed capital,
working capital or liquid capital.”4 It is “the act of the entrepreneur.” Saving, however, “is the act of the individual consumer and consists in the
negative act of refraining from spending the whole of his current income
on consumption” (CW V, p. 155). The two actors, savers and investors, are
brought together by the banking system and financial markets, under the
leadership of the central bank.
The balance or imbalance between savings and investment, in the
Treatise model, is determined by the interest rate (setting aside, for convenience, the fact that in the real world there are many interest rates) or,
more precisely, the oscillation of the market rate of interest around a “natural” rate. The natural rate is defined, somewhat circularly, as the rate that
would equalize savings and investment, thereby keeping the price of investment goods steady (CW V, p. 139). If the market rate rises relative to
the natural rate, savings will be encouraged and investment depressed; if
it falls, investment will rise relative to savings. “Booms and slumps…are
simply…an oscillation of the terms of credit about their equilibrium position” (CW V, p. 165).5 This assumes, of course, that savings are stimulated
and investment is depressed by higher interest rates; although there’s some
truth to these axioms, and even more intuitive appeal, actual reality demonstrates much looseness in the relations. But let’s not quibble for now.
If credit markets were perfect, changes in interest rates could balance
savings and investment perfectly, just as price is supposed to equilibrate
supply and demand in all competitive markets. Markets are imperfect (or
don’t clear) if not every buyer or seller can be satisfied at the “proper”
price. Credit markets are far from perfect, Keynes argued; there always
exists an “unsatisfied fringe” of borrowers who can’t find credit because
banks turn them down (CW V, p. 190). Or, the banks might say, they can’t
find enough qualified borrowers to soak up all their lending potential (hard
193

WALL STREET

to imagine before 1990). In the 1930s and the early 1990s, low interest
rates did not encourage credit expansion because lenders, and possibly
borrowers, had been scared by the recent credit implosion. This important notion of credit rationing would be largely forgotten as fantasies of
perfect markets infected the economics profession during the 1960s and
1970s, but it would later reappear in the politically cautious “information
assymetry” literature. It shows that not only the price of credit — the interest rate — is economically important, but also the ease of its availability —
its quantity — as well. In high market theory, flexible prices assure a balance between supply and demand; but in real life, there may be unslaked
urges to lend or borrow regardless of price.
Though the mood of the “public” counts for something — bearishness
will drive up long-term rates — changes in interest rates are “normally”
led by a nation’s central bank, when it decides to change “the level of
money incomes” (CW V, p. 142). Credit availability, and with it the size of
the “unsatisfied fringe,” will probably move in tandem with central bank
policy. Sustained periods during which the market rate is held below the
natural rate will result in explosive credit demand, runaway investment,
and a rising price level, that will continue as long as the central bank permits (CW V, pp. 176–177). Conversely, periods during which the market
rate is held above the natural rate will be ones of low investment and
falling prices. Public sentiment can also move market rates; a bearish mood
will push up long-term interest rates.
The natural rate itself is not a constant thing; a change in market rates
often sets off a change in the natural rate in the opposite direction. For
example, if market rates fall, the natural rate will rise, as entrepreneurs
come to expect rising prices in the future. Higher future prices hold the
promise of higher future profits, which makes new investments more attractive. While this may provoke a “reaction” sometime in the future —
higher investment demand will drive up the price of investment goods,
thereby offsetting the possibility of higher profits — the short-term effect
is undeniably stimulative (CW V, p. 189–190).
Changes in the natural rate may also come from the “real” side of an
economy. Keynes followed Joseph Schumpeter in arguing that technical
and organizational innovations adopted by a handful of especially spirited entrepreneurs, which competition forces the less pioneering to adopt,
are at the heart of capitalist progress. But these innovators would be nothing more than frustrated dreamers if the banking system — or, more
broadly, financiers — didn’t accommodate them by allowing them to rent
194

RENEGADES

other people’s money (CW VI, pp. 85–86). A wave of innovation will raise
average profit rates (at least in the short run, before imitators crash the
innovators’ party), raising the natural rate of interest. If market rates lag, as
they usually do, changes in the natural rate, investment will be stimulated
in the wake of the pioneers.

Keynes’s heresy
Writing in 1930, Keynes was most interested in the process of deflation
and in countering the dangerous advice of conventional finance. Orthodoxy put the pound back on gold at a punishingly high rate in 1925, torturing British industry and pushing up unemployment in the name of sound
money. Central banks, Keynes feared, were being too timid about bringing down interest rates. Against orthodoxy’s austerity nostrums, Keynes
celebrated booms in a manner that would do a Texas populist proud.
Shakespeare, said Keynes, died rich, and his days were “the palmy days of
profit — one of the greatest ‘bull’ movements ever known until modern
days in the United States…. [B]y far the greater proportion of the world’s
greatest writers and artists have flourished in the atmosphere of buoyancy, exhilaration and the freedom from economic cares felt by the governing class, which is engendered by profit inflations” (CW VI, p. 137).
The Shakespeares of the era of junk finance have yet to be discovered,
unless Bret Easton Ellis qualifies.
Keynes’s repeated violations of the canons of orthodox finance are refreshing in these neo-Calvinist days of plant closures, mass layoffs, fiscal
austerity, and mightily tightfisted central banks. We need not worry, argued Keynes, if entrepreneurs blow their money on riotous living; the
money will return to their class in the form of excess profits in consumption industries. Investment, in so buoyant a clime, would take care of itself. This charming passage, which is bound to make a sadomonetarist
scream, is worth quoting at length:
[T]he opinion, which I have sometimes heard expressed, that the real wealth
of the community increases faster, in spite of appearances to the contrary,
during a depression than during a boom, must be erroneous. For it is a high
rate of investment which must necessarily by definition be associated with
a high rate of increment of accumulated wealth. Thus I am more disposed
to sympathise with Mr D.H. Robertson, who thinks that much of the material progress of the nineteenth century might have been impossible without
the artificial stimulus to capital accumulation afforded by the successive

195

WALL STREET

periods of boom, than with the puritans of finance — sometimes extreme
individualists, who are able, perhaps, to placate in this way their suppressed
reactions against the distastefulness of capitalism — who draw a gloomy
satisfaction from the speculative and business losses, the low prices, and
the high real wages, accompanied, however, by unemployment, which
characterise the typical depression. Nor is it a sufficient justification of the
latter state of affairs, that, necessity being the mother of invention, there are
certain economies and technical improvements which the business world
will only make under the stimulus of distress; for there are other improvements which will only mature in an atmosphere of optimism and abundance (CW V, p. 246).

Booms are not automatic, and thrift campaigns are dangerous. It’s not
guaranteed that the savings encouraged by a thrift campaign — assuming
they materialize at all, since the record of various tax breaks extended in
the U.S., like IRAs, to encourage savings is dismal — will end up financing
productive investments; they may end up causing an increase in unwanted
inventories instead, or an inflation of stock prices as money pours into the
market rather than the real world. If there’s no increase in real investment,
the excessive “savings” are merely offset by losses among consumer goods
producers. “There is no increase of wealth in any shape or form corresponding to the increase of saving — the saving has resulted in nothing
whatever except a change and change-about between those who consume and between those who own titles to wealth.” Loss-making entrepreneurs would have to make up their shortfalls through borrowing; instead
of financing new investment, the new savings in this unfortunate case
merely finance losses. (CW V, pp. 121, 154–157; VI, pp. 185–186). The
analysis is relevant in these days when increasing savings is touted as a
social goal without any regard for how the savings will find their way into
investment, or the risks of what could happen should they not.
In the Treatise, Keynes rebuked the world’s central banks for being too
slow to lower interest rates in the 1920s and into the 1930s. Massive savings in the years after World War I were simply “spilled,” financing entrepreneurs’ losses in the deflation that accompanied the effort to revive the
pre-war gold standard (CW VI, p. 185). Keynes also rebuked the U.S. Federal Reserve for shutting down the 1920s bull market with high interest
rates. Writing in 1930, before it became clear that capitalism was in the
early days of its worst crisis ever, he argued that the slump was caused
mainly by the period of tight money during the late 1920s, “and only sec196

RENEGADES

ondarily” by the stock market crash itself. High rates simultaneously discouraged investment and encouraged savings — a double whammy —
and the crash only made matters worse on both counts. Anticipating the
role psychology would play in the General Theory, he argued that a bull
market makes people feel richer, more likely to spend and less likely to
save, and a bear run has just the opposite effect. Central bankers shouldn’t
worry about the price of existing securities (which is what a stock market
overwhelmingly is); instead, they should concern themselves with keeping new savings and investment in balance (CW V, 230; VI, 176). How this
balancing act can be managed was never revealed; presumably the central bank will be able to zero in on the natural rate, which is something
that can never be seen. And Keynes essentially ignored the dangers of a
financial mania — waste and fraud on a tremendous scale. While his celebration of excess may seem refreshing in a period of austerity, it seems
less excusable in one of a market boom accompanied by widespread poverty, not to mention looming ecological crisis.

classical comforts
Instability, or at least the possibility of it, is built into Keynes’s fundamental equations. Unlike the simple identity of MV=PT, his system is rich with
potential imbalances — between consumption and savings, between savings and investment, between the public mood and the intentions of the
central bank. These imbalances are a bit reminiscent of Marxian models of
overproduction, disproportionalities between capital and consumer goods
industries, and deflationary seizure. Keynes, however, displayed confidence in the ability of central bankers to guide the system safely around
these rocks in its path.
Despite the emphasis on disequilibrium, “at a deeper level the theory is
still comfortingly classical” (Leijonhufvud 1992). Considerable powers of
self-adjustment still inhere in the Treatise’s system. At some point, for example, bearish speculators are likely to tire of selling bonds and find that
interest rates had risen enough to make them a tempting purchase once
again. In another classical touch, prices do the adjusting, not output, which
makes no allowance for the extended unemployment of capital and labor.
The natural rate of interest is also an orthodox idea, though Keynes
allowed for the market rate to deviate considerably from it. It is a notion
associated most closely with Knut Wicksell, who was hot in pursuit of a
“neutral” monetary system — one that behaved the same way a hypothetical world without paper money would behave. To Wicksell, the dan197

WALL STREET

ger was that the credit system would keep market interest rates below
their natural level, fuelling loan demand, increasing the money supply,
and fostering inflation. The importance of the natural rate lies in its relation to the prevailing rate of profit: if money can be borrowed at 5%, and
invested in real assets (or bonds representing real assets) at 7%, then prospective borrowers will mob their banks, baying for credit. Keynes, on the
other hand, was worried about deflation.
This connection between the natural interest rate and the rate of profit
takes us back to an even more classical world than Wicksell’s, where profits ultimately determine the interest rate, rather than balancing savings
and investment. Ricardo quoted this observation by Adam Smith approvingly: “[T]he market rate of interest will lead us to form some notion of the
rate of profits, and the history of the progress of interest afford us that of
the progress of profits.” Unfortunately, Ricardo commented, states have,
“from mistaken notions of policy,” often kept interest rates from rising to
appropriate levels, compromising their use as a proxy for profit rates.
Ricardo did concede that the interest rate, “though ultimately and permanently governed by the rate of profit, is, however, subject to temporary
variations from other causes.” Arguing like the faithful quantity theorist he
was, Ricardo argued that changes in the stock of money will affect the
price level, and with it interest rates, as will temporary fluctuations in trade.
If, for example, prices fall because of an abundance of supply, a diminished demand, or a fall in the quantity of money, manufacturers will accumulate unsold inventories. To meet necessary payments, industrialists will
have to borrow to cover the losses, pushing up market interest rates. But
these stresses always contain the seeds of their own resolution: either prices
rebound, and manufacturers are restored to solvency, or they don’t and
they go bust and disappear. “[M]oney and interest regain their real value.”
Like Ricardo, the Keynes of the Treatise thought that price changes were
the way to restore equilibrium, though Keynes imagined a large role for
the central bank in assuring the adjustments were made.
In the years after the Treatise was published, Keynes rethought these
classical notions. It became clear that changes in output had to play a
much larger role. In a 1931 lecture, Keynes offered the observation that an
economy may come to rest at a “spurious equilibrium,” with a low level of
production and employment (CW XIII, p. 356). This was a rejection of one
of the central features of classical economics: supply can never exceed
demand, and consequently the long-term unemployment of people and
machines can’t happen. Obviously it does, though many mainstream
198

RENEGADES

economists still insist that human idleness can only be voluntary in such a
miraculous self-equilibrating system as capitalism.
monetarism: money all, money nothing
In 1932 and 1933, Keynes began developing what he called a monetary
theory of production, a phrase he used as the title of a short 1933 essay.
The classical economists of the 18th and 19th centuries wrote as if money
didn’t exist, or, more precisely, existed only “as a neutral link between
transactions in real things and real assets and does not allow it to enter
into motives or decisions.” In such a world, the level of prices has no
effect on production, consumption, or the willingness to lend or borrow.
But, as Keynes pointed out, wages are “sticky,” meaning they don’t change
as rapidly as commodity prices, and debt contracts are denominated in
money terms, meaning that if prices fall, entrepreneurs will have trouble
meeting their wage bills and servicing their debts. In classical doctrine, a
fall in prices would be either neutral, since money prices don’t matter for
real exchange, or possibly stimulative, since the fall in prices might increase demand. Conveniently, Keynes noted, in a world of neutral money,
“crises do not occur” (emphasis in original). For someone writing in 1933,
at the trough of depression, this “assumed away the very matter under
investigation” (CW XIII, pp. 408–411).
Right-wing icon Friedrich Hayek introduced the term “neutrality of
money” into English, attributing it wrongly to Wicksell; it was actually a
product of Dutch and German writers of the 1920s (Hayek 1932, pp. 27–
28; Patinkin 1992). The doctrine, though not the term, goes back to the
mid-18th century and David Hume (“it is of no manner of consequence …
whether money be in greater or less quantity”); two famous statements of
the theory, incorporated into the creeds of many economists, belong to
John Stuart Mill (“there cannot, in short, be intrinsically a more insignificant thing, in the economy of society, than money”) and Irving Fisher
(“money is a veil”).
Quoting both Mill and Fisher approvingly, Milton Friedman and Anna
Jacobson Schwartz (1963, p. 696) nonetheless spied a hole in the veil, one
torn by governments, typically by their central banks, which make terrible
errors when they try to reverse the fundamentally unappealable judgments
of The Market. Most of these errors are misguided attempts to stimulate
the economy, as for example the inflation of the 1960s and 1970s, which
Friedman and his spawn argue was caused by excessive generosity by the
199

WALL STREET

world’s central banks. They do have a point; the excessive extension of
credit beyond an economy’s capacity to satisfy the resultant demand will
give rise to inflation. But this argument ignores the reason governments
used to try to stimulate economies — chronically high levels of unemployment. (It also ignores the endogeneity of money, of which more later.)
Friedman and Schwartz also blamed capitalism’s most dire crisis, the Great
Depression, on the allegedly tightfisted policies of the Federal Reserve, an
argument that has the pleasant ideological effect of acquitting the inner
workings of the market system — such as the overproduction of commodities combined with the polarization of incomes that characterized
the 1920s — of any involvement. Crises may occur, inflationary or deflationary, but they’re the state’s fault.
Friedman (1962) used to urge that central banks be required by law or
“monetary constitution” to increase the quantity of money at a constant
rate of 3–5% a year. Thirty years later, Friedman’s faith seemed a bit shaken:
“It is tempting to conclude from the close average relation between changes
in the quantity of money and changes in money income that control over
the quantity of money can be used as a precision instrument for offsetting
the forces making for instability in money income. Unfortunately, the loose
relation between money and income over short periods, the long and variable lag between changes in the quantity of money and other variables,
and the often conflicting objectives of policy-makers preclude precise offsetting control” (Friedman 1992). Now he tells us.
Quantity theorists have almost unanimously made exceptions for
money’s non-neutrality in the short term: a jolt of fresh money could, by
goosing up prices, boost confidence, profits, and production for a little
while. But, it was further argued, the stimulus would only be transitory, as
a new equilibrium was reached. Put another way, as Friedman (1968b)
did in his classic screed “The Role of Monetary Policy,” central banks can
only peg nominal quantities, not real ones: “the real rate of interest, the
rate of unemployment, the level of real national income, the real quantitity
of money” are all beyond its powers. “The price level is then a joint outcome of the monetary forces determining nominal income and the real
forces determining real income” (Friedman 1970). In other words, prices
and output, the monetary and the real, are separately, not mutually, determined. So while money might be influential in the short view, it was neutral in the long. Why the long term should be fundamentally different from
the sum of many short terms is a bit mysterious. And why too the quantity
theorists, passionate believers in monetary neutrality, always care with
200

RENEGADES

equal passion about inflation is equally mysterious. If money prices don’t
matter, then why does inflation? But if inflation — “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,” in the Friedmanite mantra — does matter, then money can’t really be neutral, can it?
Monetarism officially prevailed in the U.S. from 1979, on Paul Volcker’s
ascension to the chair of the Federal Reserve, to 1982, when it was abandoned for ostensibly technical reasons, but actually because the U.S.
economy was falling apart, the financial system was making horrible
sounds, and Mexico was on the verge of default (Greider 1987). In truth,
Volcker’s adoption of monetarism was a ruse for driving up interest rates
to unprecedentedly high levels to create a deep recession, to break inflation, and with it, to crush the last traces of labor militancy.
The Thatcher government inflicted an even more savage monetarism
on Britain over the same period. According to Friedman’s advice to the
Iron Lady, the late-1970s inflation could easily have been defeated with
“only a modest reduction in output money growth and inflation
and employment” (quoted in Gilmour

ute income and power toward capital — which certainly can’t be considered neutral in the long term.
Ironically, even the periods of recession and recovery disprove monetarist dogma, as the nearby table shows. Britain showed a sharper decline in inflation than the decline in money growth would argue for, and
the U.S. saw a decline in inflation despite a increase in the pace of money
growth.6 We’ll return to this later, when looking at theories of where money
comes from — from on high, or from below.
money changes everything
Having proven money to be non-neutral, and monetarism to be silly, it’s
time to move back to Keynes. In the years between the Treatise and the
General Theory, Keynes came to see that money invalidated Say’s law, the
classical doctrine that assumed that supply creates its own demand. Here’s
how Ricardo (1911/1987, pp. 192–193) put it in a famous passage:
No man produces but with a view to consume or sell, and he never sells but
with an intention to purchase some other commodity, which may be immediately useful to him, or which he may contribute to future production. By
producing, then, he necessarily becomes either the consumer of his own
goods, or the purchaser and consumer of the goods of some other person.

But in the real world, a “man” sells only to accumulate money, and he
may be slow in exchanging that money for either consumer (“immediately useful”) or capital goods (“contribut[ions] to future production”). In
the classical world, where money has no autonomous influence, goods’
and securities’ prices move so that interest rates fall into line with the returns on other assets. Keynes, however, was preparing to argue that the
rate of interest is “determined by forces partly appropriate to itself, and
that prices move until the marginal efficiency of other assets falls into line
with the rate of interest” (CW XIV, p. 103).
In classical theory, Keynes also argued, the factors of production were
assumed as given; at issue only was their use and relative rewards. Knowledge was assumed to be sound, and
facts and expectations were assumed to be given in a definite and calculable form; and risks, of which, though admitted, not much notice was taken,
were supposed to be capable of an exact actuarial computation. The calculus of probability, though mention of it was kept in the background, was

202

RENEGADES

supposed to be capable of reducing uncertainty to the same calculable status as that of certainty itself; just as in the Benthamite calculus of pains and
pleasures or of advantage and disadvantage, by which the Benthamite philosophy assumed men to be influenced in their general ethical behavior
(CW XIV, p. 112).

In the real world, however, uncertainty could not be statistically domesticated. When the future looks especially uncertain, investors will be shy of
commitments, holding a large chunk of their wealth in cash. Uncertainty
in a world of non-neutral money can cause all kinds of trouble.
Keynes departed from his predecessors in placing expectations at the
center of economic decision-making. Take, for example, his idea of “effective demand.” In Keynes’s definition, effective demand is “simply the
aggregate income (or proceeds) which the entrepreneurs expect to receive, inclusive of the income which they will hand on to the other factors
of production, from the amount of current employment which they decide to give” (CW VII, p. 55). As Victoria Chick has written, the term is
somewhat unfortunate. It is sometimes misconstrued to refer to the “demand one can back up by purchasing power,” in contrast to notional demand, which is what one would demand could one sell all one’s labor
power for wages. (Given the power of imagination, notional demand could
be considered nearly infinite.) Effective demand is the aggregate of entrepreneurs’ expectations of their sales on which they base their production
decisions — but their production decisions (how many workers to hire,
how long to work them, how many units to produce, etc.) in turn in large
part determine demand, since incomes from production are what provide
the juice for demand (Chick 1983, pp. 64–65).
Similarly, entrepreneurs’ investment decisions and rentiers’ decisions
about the allocation of their savings between cash and long-lived assets
are also based largely on expectations. Normally, economic actors derive
their expectations for the future from convention and from recent history,
assuming “that the present is a much more serviceable guide to the future
than a candid examination of past experience would show it to have been
hitherto” (CW XIV, p. 114). This self-deception is a stabilizing force, since
economic life, anarchists’ appealing dreams aside, would be unimaginable in a world that was constantly turning itself upside down. In turbulent times, however, savers and investors, producers and consumers, all
will come to expect the worst, assuming that present turbulence will continue indefinitely. When people fear for the future, they pull in their horns
203

WALL STREET

and keep whatever assets they have in something secure; usually that
means cash, or something like it, rather than stocks, bonds, or factories.
In Classicalworld, expectations are always rational, resources employed
to their fullest, and “inactive balances are zero” (CW XXIX, pp. 215, 256–
257; VII, p. 26; italics in original). In Keynesworld, expectations are not
necessarily rational, resources can remain unemployed for a long time,
and inactive balances (hoards, in plain English) can be much greater than
zero. Or, as George Shackle put it in his elegant summary of Keynes’s
General Theory: “To buy the means…of producing goods is to gamble on
the eventual sale of those goods. From time to time businessmen lose
their nerve and refuse this gamble, preferring to keep their wealth in money
rather than embark it in the products of employment” (quoted in Moore
1988b, p. 249). The classicals were wrong; an economy will not necessarily come to rest with the full employment of capital and labor.
To Keynes, the most crucial problem of a modern capitalist economy
was evoking a sufficiently high level of investment to assure full employment, and it’s here that uncertainty and the comforts of money work their
devilment. Entrepreneurs will only invest if they expect the new investment to yield a greater income over its life than it will cost them to finance
the asset; in Keynes’s jargon, the marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) must
be greater than the interest rate they pay their bankers.7
While this may not seem like an extraordinarily original idea at first,
there are at least two points of interest in the formulation. First is the notion that money is central to investment decisions; Keynes had no truck
with mainstream pieties about production serving consumer needs. “The
firm…has no object in the world except to end up with more money than
it started with” (CW XXIX, p. 89). Second is the notion that expectations
are central to investment decisions; the expectations may be wrong or
right, rational or irrational, but whatever the case, they matter enormously.
It’s not only the expectations of industrial managers that matter to investment; the MEC must be measured against the interest rate, and “the
rate of interest is a highly psychological phenomenon” (CW VII, p. 202).
The General Theory banished all notions of the interest rate balancing
savings and investment (or, put another way, balancing the supply of and
demand for savings), cut it free of any intimate relation with profit rates,
and discarded the concept of a natural rate of interest. If the natural rate is
defined as the one that maintains the status quo, there can be many natural rates of interest, each associated with a different level of employment
— “and, in general, we have no predominant interest in the status quo.”8
204

RENEGADES

If there is any rate of interest that deserves special status, Keynes argued,
it’s the one associated with full employment (CW VII, p. 243). One of the
goals of economic analysis and policy should be to discover and attain
that optimum rate.
Interest rates are a function of the generosity or tightness of the central
bank and the demand for money, which Keynes called the state of liquidity preference. Liquidity preference depended on three things in The
General Theory (CW VII, pp. 168–174) — the transactions motive, the
need for cash to cover personal and business expenses; the precautionary
motive, the desire for a cash cushion in the face of future uncertainty; and
the speculative motive, cash kept like dry powder, for taking quick advantage of market mis-valuations (like buying a stock that has been hammered down). To those three, Keynes later added a fourth, a finance motive,
entrepreneurs’ short-term demand for cash in the early stages of an investment project, “the credit required in the interval between planning
and execution” (CW XIV, pp. 216, 218). In bad times, like the 1930s, fear
increased the degree of liquidity preference to crippling levels; everyone
wanted the safety of cash, and no one dared go out on a limb.

once more, with feeling
In the exposition of liquidity preference in General Theory, Keynes emphasized the psychological state of financial actors — rentiers and City
professionals. When expectations are bearish, it takes a very high interest
rate to lure rentiers from the security of cash; when they’re bullish, it doesn’t
take much.9 Rather than being the reward for not-spending, the classic
Protestant–moralizing theory of interest, interest represents the reward for
“not-hoarding” — for taking a risk, for becoming less liquid. But there’s
more to the demand for money than the desirability of hoarding, as Keynes
emphasized in a letter to D.H. Robertson. Liquidity preference is also determined by “the scale of planning and activity and the level of costs” (CW
XIV, p. 224). The demand for money can increase either out of enthusiasm or anxiety, in a boom or a panic, which will push up interest rates,
other factors (like central bank policy) remaining unchanged.
Sentiment is at the center of Keynes’s theory of investment, and his
most justifiably famous exploration of the financial passions is Chapter 12
of The General Theory, “The State of Long-Term Expectations,” one of the
most splendid analyses of speculative markets ever written. Keynes argued that asset prices are powered by wild swings of temperament, the
volatile judgments of an ignorant herd, and these noisy signals guide real
205

investment, to the detriment of prosperity. Markets are populated by dispersed investors with little knowledge of the real businesses they own or
lend money to. “Day-to-day fluctuations” in the fortunes of enterprises “of
an ephemeral and non-significant character, tend to have an altogether
excessive, and even an absurd, influence on the market. American companies which manufacture ice tend to sell at a higher price in summer
when their profits are seasonally high than in winter when no one wants
ice” (CW VII, pp. 153–154). Ice sounds quaint, but the principle still holds
true; the stock prices of retailers respond to advance indexes of weekly
sales that have little relation to final, definitive sales figures. “[T]he energies and skill of the professional investor and speculator” are concerned
not with serious long-term forecasts, “but with foreseeing changes in the
conventional basis of valuation a short time ahead of the general public.”
Thus the professional investor is forced to concern himself with the anticipation of impending changes, in the news or in the atmosphere, of the kind
by which experience shows that the mass psychology of the market is most
influenced. This is the inevitable result of investment markets organized
with a view to so-called “liquidity.” Of the maxims of orthodox finance
none, surely, is more anti-social than the fetish of liquidity…. It forgets that
there is no such thing as liquidity of investment for the community as a
whole. The social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark
forces of time and ignorance which envelop our future. The actual, private
object of the most skilled investment to-day is to “beat the gun,” as the
Americans so well express it, to outwit the crowd, and to pass the bad, or
depreciating, half-crown to the other fellow (CW VII, p. 155).

This game — which Keynes likened to Snap, or Old Maid, or Musical
Chairs — is one of “the third degree where we devote our intelligences to
anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And
there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.” Or, as he put it in The Treatise, the point is to “ape unreason
proleptically” (CW VI, p. 323). Nothing could be truer. Some evidence
that he was right is that unlike many economists, Keynes was a brilliant
speculator who made himself and his Cambridge college a fortune.10
These gyrations might seem silly, decadent, or wasteful, but their danger lies in their influence on real investment. “Speculators may do no harm
as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious
when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When
the capital development of a country becomes the by-product of the ac206

RENEGADES

tivities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done” (CW VII, p. 159). Keynes
had the America of the 1920s in mind when he wrote this, but he could
have been writing about this country, and increasingly many others, over
the last 15–20 years.
In a narrow sense he was wrong. Changes in stock prices really don’t
have that much influence on real investment; insofar as they have an economic logic at all, they merely reflect (and usually amplify) changes in
interest rates and the availability of credit, which in turn influence real
demand, and eventually real investment. We saw this in Chapter 4, with
the dissection of q theory and the review of the work of Morck, Shleifer,
and Vishny (1990) showing that investment responds to fundamental variables like sales and cash flow, both at the firm and aggregate levels, with
stock returns adding little or no explanatory power to their models. Further, Morck and comrades conclude that “The notion that the stock market evaluates the long-term prospects of the economy, and so guides
long-term investment, is not supported by the data.”
Thank God for that. Keynes’s instinctive description of the forces behind stock markets are accurate, but their influence on investment is nothing like what he made it seem. But there’s intense interest among Wall
Streeters and their pet academics for forcing managers to be more obsessed with pushing up their stock prices than they already are. As a longterm strategy, this seems frightfully wrong.
But just looking at the relationship between stock prices and investment is to specify the matter too narrowly. The stock market isn’t just
about prices, it’s about the control of whole corporations, which are bought
and sold, combined and liquidated, often on purely financial considerations through the mechanisms of the stock exchange. So the judgments
of an ignorant, greedy, and excitable mob do have considerable real world
effects. Even less measurable is the effect of the new shareholder
assertiveness. The effect of both active M&A and rentier assertiveness is to
affect corporate policies in qualitiative ways that mere investment figures
can’t measure. We’ll return to these topics in the Chapter 6.
Keynes: a heretic of sorts
Liquidity preference draws attention away from the level of savings and
towards the question of how they’re allocated. Orthodoxy argued in
Keynes’s day, and continues to argue in ours, that higher savings rates are
to be encouraged, so that new investment could be more cheaply financed.
207

WALL STREET

The implication is that investment capital is short. Keynes argued instead
that while investment can be “congested” through a shortage of cash —
difficulty in amassing borrowed money under the finance motive — it
never can be congested by a shortage of savings. He called this “the most
fundamental of my conclusions within this field.” For the society as a whole,
long-term investment can fund itself. “Increased investment will always
be accompanied by increased saving,” wrote the optimistic Keynes, “but
it can never be preceded by it. Dishoarding and credit expansion provides not an alternative to increased saving, but a necessary preparation
for it. It is the parent, not the twin, of increased saving.” Attempts to reduce pressure on cash by cutting back consumption — the prescription of
orthodox thrift-promoters of the 1920s and the 1990s — will do so, but
only by depressing income and ultimately investment. Moreover, “spending releases funds just as much as saving does, and … these funds when
released can then be used indifferently for the production either of capital
goods or of consumption goods” (CW XIV, pp. 216, 219, 222, 229, 232,
281, 282). Money must circulate, not congeal into a hoard.
Like the Treatise, the General Theory’s message is resolutely expansive: spending, not sparing, generates wealth. Moralists, whether Calvinist, neoclassical, or even Marxist, find this aspect of Keynes scandalous, a
reaction he seemingly went out of his way to provoke. Much of Chapter
23 is devoted to a rehabilitation of historical kindred spirits, of whom official opinion disapproves: mercantilists, immoralists, underconsumptionists,
promoters of usury laws — even that old monetary crank Silvio Gesell.
Among the immoralists is a book that a Middlesex grand jury of 1723
convicted of being a nuisance, Bernard Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees.
The poem and commentaries “set forth the appalling plight of a prosperous community in which all the citizens suddenly take it into their heads
to abandon luxurious living, and the State to cut down on armaments, in
the interests of Saving” (CW VII, pp. 359–362). The community sinks into
deflation and despair. Mandeville’s tale is “not without a theoretical basis,” as Keynes points out. In the commentary, Mandeville argued that
while an individual family can save itself rich, a nation cannot — an observation that Adam Smith probably had in mind when he wrote, contrary
to the fabulist, “What is prudence in the conduct of every private family
can scarce be folly in that of a great Kingdom.” Mandeville’s advice to the
state was to practice the economics of joy, encouraging manufactures,
arts, and agriculture to produce to their fullest, and to cultivate “the Fruits
of the Earth and the Labour of the People, both of which joined together
208

RENEGADES

are a more certain, a more inexhaustible and more real Treasure than the
Gold of Brazil or the Silver of Potosi.”
To this Keynes added his own fillip:
No wonder that such wicked sentiments called down the opprobrium of
two centuries of moralists and economists who felt much more virtuous in
possession of their austere doctrine that no sound remedy was discoverable except in the utmost of thrift and economy both by the individual and
by the state. Petty’s “entertainments, magnificent shews, triumphal arches,
etc.” give place to the penny-wisdom of Gladstonian finance and to a state
system which “could not afford” hospitals, open spaces, noble buildings,
even the preservation of its ancient monuments, far less the splendours of
music and the drama, all of which were consigned to the private charity or
magnanimity of improvident individuals.

By Keynes’s telling, Mandevillean exuberance disappeared from respectable circles until Malthus who, like Keynes, opposed Smith’s doctrine that
capital is increased by parsimony. Malthus feared that mass poverty would
cause a chronic insufficiency of demand, leaving capital and labor to languish unemployed. Against this tendency towards anemia, Malthus celebrated the economically stimulative effect of “unproductive consumption
on the part of the landlords and capitalists” (CW VII, p. 363).
Here Keynes seems very much like a rebel within his own class. As
Marx (1963, pp. 170–172) argued, Mandeville and Malthus were part of an
offensive to counter Adam Smith’s distinction between productive and
unproductive labor. Capitalism, Marx argued, reproduced “everything
against which it had fought in feudal or absolutist form” — a parasitical
elite. Smith, speaking for the early capitalists, found this stratum an obstacle; they contributed nothing useful, consuming social wealth but producing nothing in return. This was not well-received among the better
orders. In Marx’s words, the “‘higher grade’ workers — such as state officials, military people, artists, doctors, priests, judges, lawyers, etc. — some
of whom are not only not productive but in essence destructive…found it
not at all pleasant to be relegated economically to the same class as clowns
and menial servants and to appear merely as…parasites on the actual producers.” This “compromise” between the capitalists and the burdensome
elite found “the do-nothings and their parasites…a place in this best possible order of things.” Malthus and Mandeville, Marx conceded, were to
be preferred to later apologists, because they recognized the parasitism of
the unproductive even as they found their overconsumption helpful.
209

WALL STREET

Mandeville even held that “Evil” is what makes us social creatures, and is
“the solid Basis, the Life and Support of all Trades and Employments without exception” (Marx 1963, pp. 375–376).
Though Keynes declared himself an eternal immoralist (CW X, p. 447),
there’s no celebration of evil in his work, and he was too humane to celebrate the stimulative powers of parasites. But he often flinched when
confronting the issue of what money should be invested in. Though he
acknowledged that it would be better to “build houses and the like,” it
would be better than nothing to have the Treasury “fill old bottles with
banknotes,” bury them, and tender for contracts for people to dig them up
again (CW VII, p. 129). Of course he was being ironic, but irony is a way
of disguising an embarrassing truth. Later in the General Theory, Keynes
said that in an economy with an unemployment rate of 10%, there’s no
reason to suppose that the employed 90% are seriously misemployed; the
tragedy has nothing to do with what’s produced, and only to do with the
insufficiency of production. Despite his unmasking of markets as not selfadjusting, Keynes stated his aim to be indicating the “nature of the environment which the free play of economic forces requires” if the “Manchester
System” is to realize its full potential. Once the planning bureaucrats get
everything right, the “classical theory comes into its own again” (CW VII,
pp. 378–379). Post-Keynesians rightly wail about the banalizing abuse
Keynes suffered at the hands of the bastard Keynesians, but the Master
himself had already done a good job showing them where to start. And
remember he celebrated Gesell as the avatar of an anti-Marxian socialism
who promised the flourishing of competition rather than its abolition.
Yet this apologia comes just pages after passages proclaiming the need
for the “somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment,” arguing
that extreme inequality of wealth and income hurt economic performance
rather than helping it, and proposing the “euthanasia of the rentier, of the
functionless investor” (CW VII, pp. 375–378). What the socialization of
investment meant was left rather vague in the General Theory. It did not
mean “state socialism,” Keynes assured; most likely, it meant the state would
merely determine investment levels and their rewards. Keynes offered some
more detail in a letter to Hawtrey. While it was “theoretically conceivable
that communal saving might have to be loaned to private enterprise,” the
“Board of National Investment would in one way or another control by far
the greater part of investment. Private enterprise (meaning industry) requires such a tiny fragment of total savings that it could probably look
after itself. Building, transport and public utilities are almost the only out210

RENEGADES

lets for new capital on a large scale.” Public sector investment would make
capital so plentiful that it would lose its scarcity value, interest rates would
drop to zero, and the functionless investor would disappear. It all could
be done gradually, with no revolution, “without a break in the general
traditions of society” (CW XIV, p. 49).
Yet even this program, for all its evasions and contradictions, is revolutionary in the eyes of capital. Private investment is largely self-financing,
as Keynes argued, but to ignore it is to ignore what shapes the evolution
of much of our physical and social environment. Capital could be made
plentiful in the physical sense, but a system of production organized for
money profits — which Keynes acknowledged capitalism to be — will
have none of it. Rentiers, while they may be socially functionless, are nonetheless the owners of the productive capital stock, and the creditors of its
hired managers. They would never concede to their “euthanasia,” since
they have never thought their condition terminal, at least since the mid1930s. Nor would employers ever consent to a regime of full employment; it would be the death of work discipline.
One gets the sense, reading Keynes, that the driving force behind capitalism is sentiment, the bullish or bearish state of expectations, and that
social reality is important only insofar as it changes expectations through
surprise, pleasant or unpleasant. This is consonant with Keynes’s highly
aestheticized view of the world, his rebellion against what he called
the extraordinary contraption of the Benthamite School, by which all possible consequences of alternative courses of action were supposed to have
attached to them, first a number expressing their comparative advantage,
and secondly another number expressing the probability of their following
from the course of action in question; so that multiplying together the numbers attached to all the possible consequences of a given action and adding
the results, we could discover what to do. In this way a mythical system of
probable knowledge was employed to reduce the future to the same calculable status as the present (CW XIV, p. 124).

Keynes has a point; this is what mythmakers of the efficient market school
do, transform radical uncertainty into statistical risk. In this reaction, however, Keynes returns to the spirit of his undergraduate circle at Cambridge,
where “nothing mattered except states of mind, our own and other people’s
of course, but chiefly our own” (CW X, p. 436).
This reaction against Bentham was so extreme that Keynes could attribute the techniques of rational calculation imposed by competitive capi211

WALL STREET

talism to a philosopher, rather than to the unsentimental, impersonal
mechanisms of the market, and at the same time describe Marxism, the
harshest systematic critique that the capitalist market has ever inspired, as
“the final reductio ad absurdam of Benthamism” (CW X, p. 446).11

Maynard and Karl
Ironically, Keynes’s interest in a “monetary theory of production” came in
part from his reading of an account of Marx’s classic formula of capitalist
production, M-C-M’ (CW XXIX, pp. 81–83). By this, Marx meant that the
capitalist throws M[oney] into production — engaging both labor and capital — to create a C[ommodity] for sale, which returns, if all goes well, a
sum of M’[oney] larger than that laid out at first. Keynes was struck by the
contrast between this and the orthodox idea that entrepreneurs produce
products in exchange for products (or the more modern, apologetic idea
that they produce to satisfy consumers). Under capitalism, the satisfaction
of needs is a positive externality of the pursuit of profit, to use the modern
language — and the planned creation of needs a less positive externality.
Keynes learned this from a second-hand source because he found the
original as unreadable as the Koran: “dreary, out-of-date, academic
controversializing” (CW XXVIII, p. 38) — though Rolf Behrens (1985) argued that Keynes read more Marx than he admitted or his colleagues knew.
As an economist, Keynes ranked Marx below the monetary cranks — something that caused Schumpeter (1936) to exclaim: “I am no Marxian. Yet I
sufficiently recognize the greatness of Marx to be offended at seeing him
classed with Silvio Gesell and Major Douglas.”12
Marxism as a political philosophy was a “delusion” (CW XVII, p. 268),
an “obsolete” and “erroneous…creed which, preferring the mud to the
fish, exalts the boorish proletariat above the bourgeois and the intelligentsia who, with whatever faults, are the quality in life and surely carry the
seeds of all human advancement.” The hated doctrine could do nothing
to “alter…human nature,” to make “Jews less avaricious or Russians less
extravagant than they were before” (CW IX, pp. 258–259). Workers he
found “boorish,” though he generously conceded that they were “not as
ugly as they might be” (quoted in Perelman 1989, p.7). Civilization is not
the product of humans working together, but “a thin and precarious crust
erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained
by rules and conventions skilfully put across and guilefully preserved”
(CW X, p. 447). “The class war,” he concluded charmingly, “will find me
on the side of the educated bourgeoisie” (CW IX, p. 297).
212

RENEGADES

The use of “educated” is an interesting qualification; it reeks of the English aristocrat’s contempt for those ordinary souls engaged in trade; despite the anti-finance bias of much of his economic writing, in his heart he
seemed closer to the City–gentry nexus than his subsequent reputation
might suggest. His arrogance, another marker of his class, could be breathtaking at times. Unlike Marx, who wanted to “organize the myriad
Lilliputians and arm them with poisoned arrows,” Keynes thought that
folks like him could manage everything through their disinterested sophistication. Marxism, he claimed, “enormously overestimates the significance of the economic problem. If you leave that to me, I will look after it”
(CW XXVIII, p. 34).
In fact, he thought the General Theory had solved “the” economic problem, in both theory and practice. With that single shot, he claimed, he’d
killed both Ricardo and Marx. To Keynes, both belonged to the “self-adjusting school” of “classical economics” (quoted in Behrens 1985), failing
as they did to grasp the doctrine of liquidity preference and the drag on
investment exerted by high interest rates. Here Marx and Ricardo are joined
in their sunniness. But elsewhere he joined them in gloom: “Marxism is a
highly plausible influence from the Ricardian economics, that capitalistic
individualism cannot possibly work in practice.” In both cases, the equivalence is as strange as Foucault’s (1973, p. 262) declaration that the struggle
between Marxians and Ricardians was “no more than storms in a children’s
paddling pool,” since they both shared a common dream of an end to
History. But Foucault had the excuse of deeming economics a 19th century concern, an excuse unavailable to an economist like Keynes.13
Keynes could not have read Marx’s (1973, p. 410) succinct criticism of
Ricardo and his colleagues for having “conceived production as directly
identical with the self-realization of capital — and hence were heedless of
the barriers to consumption or of the existing barriers of circulation itself,”
because the Grundrisse wasn’t published until three years after the General
Theory. But it would strike someone who’d bothered to read Capital as
pretty familiar stuff; after all, Ricardo isn’t exactly known as an impassioned prophet of capitalism’s demise in quite the same way Marx is.
But Keynes could have read (in German, according to Behrens, which
he read well) this from the third volume of Capital; “Those economists
like Ricardo, who take the capitalist mode of production as an absolute,
feel here that this mode of production creates a barrier for itself and seek
the source of this barrier not in production but rather in nature (in the
theory of rent)” (Marx 1981, p. 350). Were the parasitical landlords smashed,
213

WALL STREET

accumulation could continue apace. Keynes, you could say, sought the
barrier not in nature, but in the mind of the capitalist and in the excessively austere policy preferences of a sadomonetarist central bank.14 Were
the rentiers smashed, then accumulation could continue apace. In that
sense, Keynes had more in common with Ricardo than he would have
liked to admit.

Keynes and the contradictions
Five pages of the General Theory (CW VII, pp. 353–358) are devoted to
the rehabilitation of Gesell, a writer almost universally regarded as a monetary crank. Keynes sees him as a kindred renegade, vilified by the orthodox but really onto something (though of course not onto everything,
having missed the centrality of liquidity preference). Keynes celebrated
Gesell as the inventor of “an anti-Marxian socialism, a reaction against
laissez-faire built on theoretical foundations totally unlike those of Marx
in being based on a repudiation instead of on an acceptance of the classical hypotheses, and on an unfettering of competition instead of its abolition.” To Gesell, the payment of interest holds back the accumulation of
capital. If interest could be forced to zero, then accumulation would accelerate and universal prosperity would be our reward.
But of course interest rates can’t be forced to zero, nor can the rentier
be euthanized, nor can financial innovation be snuffed, without transforming capitalism in ways far more radical than Keynes envisioned. Recall Schumpeter’s (1939, vol. 2, p. 613) observation that financial innovation
“is one of the most characteristic features of the financial side of capitalist
evolution…. This is not mere technique. This is part of the core of the
capitalist process.” An attack on liquidity and innovation is an attack on
the core of the capitalist process, which is why Keynes’s suggestions have
been so thoroughly repressed by mainstream economics— rarely even
argued with, but simply ignored. Many Keynesians seem mystified by this
apparent oversight, apparently believing that ideas become dominant simply on their merits.
In times of reaction, when Marxism is regarded as beyond the pale by
many even on the left, Keynes has become a more acceptable model,
especially in these days of financial ascendancy. Few economists of any
time have had as much to say about the financial markets themselves, or
their relation to the real world. As Adorno said of Freud, “like all great
bourgeois thinkers, he left standing undissolved such contradictions [those
of bourgeois society] and disdained the assertion of pretended harmony
214

RENEGADES

where the thing itself was contradictory. He revealed the antagonistic character of the social reality” (quoted in Zizek 1994, p. 14).15 The more fervent bits — like the call for the “somewhat comprehensive socialization of
investment” — offer the appeal of radicalism, but in a calm, elegant form,
and in one that may unsettle, but not shock, the ruling order. Keynes was
a very seductive writer. But as Michael Perelman (1989, p. 1) put it in his
very useful book on Keynes, he often sounded “more radical than he was.”
Take, for example, the concept of “uncertainty,” which he made a lot
of, and his more loyal modern followers treat as revealed truth. It is an
accurate description of the conditions under which real human beings,
not Greek letters in a neat academic model, make real decisions about
investment and many other aspects of life as well. It is a powerful antidote
to the certainties of Chicago School economists. But it can only explain so
much. Post-Keynesians hold that it is the main explanation for the existence of money; if there were no uncertainty, people would be happy to
settle transactions in IOUs (backed by promises), but in an untrustworthy
world, money (backed by the state) is essential to the settlement of debts.16
While this is not without truth, this banalizes money, robbing it of its force
as the fundamental principle of social organization under capitalism.
But the real problems with Keynes lie ultimately in the naïveté and
conservatism lurking behind his sophisticated and iconoclastic style. Having (re)discovered that “entrepreneurs” (a word he and post-Keynesians
like Davidson prefer to the more loaded “capitalists”) are in business to
make money, and nothing else, he somehow concluded that rentiers will
consent to their euthanasia. Compare this vain wish to a 150-year-old observation: “In England there takes place a steady accumulation of additional wealth, which has a tendency ultimately to assume the form of
money” (quoted in Marx 1981, p. 543). A tendency indeed: money, whatever its economic role, is most definitely not neutral in its social role; the
accumulation of money is the fondest desire of every good capitalist citizen. Keynes realized this with one half of his mind, and then with the
other half thought you could tweak this fundamental tendency out of existence almost unnoticed. Having laid bare some real contradictions, he
spuriously proposed to resolve them.
And further, having discovered in two ways, those of the Treatise and
the General Theory, that capitalism does not tend of its own accord to full
employment and stability, Keynes (1936, p. 379) then declared at the end
of the General Theory that his goal was not to overturn the “Manchester
system,” but merely to liberate its full potential.
215

WALL STREET

The complaint against the present system is not that these 9,000,000 men
ought to be employed on different tasks, but that tasks should be available
for the remaining 1,000,000 men. It is in determining the volume, not the
direction, of actual investment that the existing system has broken down.
Thus I agree with Gesell that the result of filling the gaps in the classical
theory is not to dispose of the ‘Manchester System,’ but to indicate the nature of the environment which the free play of economic forces requires if
it is to realize the full potentialities of production.

The problem of capitalism lies not in the exploitation of labor, the creation of poverty amidst plenty, the abuse of nature, the atomization of
society, nor the trivialization of culture, but simply in its incompleteness
— that one in ten are denied its full delights. But given full license, Keynes
and his epigones could solve that problem. Too bad the capitalists haven’t
let them do it yet.
But they did, in a sense — not the sense in which Keynes meant it, and
post-Keynesians still mean it, but in a sense illuminated by Antonio Negri
(1988). Here’s how Keynes (CW XIV, pp. 112–122) defined uncertainty in
a 1937 essay that was a response to critics of the General Theory:
By “uncertain” knowledge, let me explain, I do not mean merely to distinguish what is known for certain from what is only probable. The game of
roulette is not subject, in this sense, to uncertainty; nor is the prospect of a
victory bond being drawn…. Even the weather is only moderately uncertain. The sense in which I am using the term is that in which the prospect of
a European war is uncertain, or the price of copper and the rate of interest
twenty years hence, or the obsolescence of a new invention, or the position of private wealth-owners in the social system in 1970. About these
matters there is no scientific basis on which o form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know.

The examples given, notably the last — “the position of private wealthowners in the social system in 1970” — are of a weighty sort, the kinds of
doubts that nag investors in the midst of crises like those of the 1930s. In
the First World, we haven’t seen its like in 60 years. Here’s how Negri read
Keynesian uncertainty and the role of the state:
Investment risks must be eliminated, or reduced to the convention, and the
state must take on the function of guaranteeing the basic convention of
economics. The state has to defend the present from the future. And if the
only way to do this is to project the future from within the present, to plan
216

RENEGADES

the future according to present expectations, then the state must extend its
intervention to take up the role of planner, and the economic thus becomes
incorporated in the juridical.... [The state] will not guarantee the certainty of
future events, but it will guarantee the certainty of the convention.... In
effect, the life of the system no longer depends on the spirit of
entrepreneurialism, but on liberation from the fear of the future.

The role of the state, then, is to stabilize expectations — to guarantee there
won’t be depressions, and to guarantee (insofar as anything can be guaranteed) the position of private wealth-owners in the system. In these senses,
bastard Keynesianism did the trick — of, to paraphrase Claus Offe, regulating the system politically without materially politicizing it. The establishment took what it needed from Keynes and left the rest.
posties
Though I’ve mentioned post-Keynesian economics several times in this
chapter, I’ve barely fleshed out the mentions. But two matters deserve
closer attention — theories of monetary endogeneity, and the work of
Hyman Minsky. Both are barely acknowledged, much less known, in the
mainstream.

money emerges from within
In conventional economics, of both the monetarist and the eclectically
mainstream varieties, the money supply (not always precisely defined) is
determined from “outside” the system of private exchange by the central
bank; these are exogenous theories of money. The Fed or any of its siblings around the world injects money into the system, and banks, households, and firms do their business accordingly. Adherents to endogenous
theories of money argue instead that the money supply is a function of the
demand for credit, which is itself a function of the level of economic activity. The banking system, along with the central bank, creates as much
money as people need, though there are disagreements on just how elastic this process is.17
Robert Pollin (1991; 1993) usefully divided the two major schools of
post-Keynesian endogenists into the accommodative and the structural.
Accommodative endogeneity holds that the central bank has no choice
but to validate private credit demand by providing whatever reserves the
banking system needs to accommodate the loans that it has already made;
217

WALL STREET

that means there is no effective constraint on credit. Leading proponents
of this school include Nicholas Kaldor and Basil Moore. Structural
endogeneity — the branch that appeals to both Pollin and me — holds
that central bank attempts to constrain the growth of credit are frequently
evaded through creative finance.
Moore (1988a, p. 139), the leading living accommodationist, takes a
good idea way too far, as he did in this surreal passage:
The process of monetary accommodation, the validation of money wage
increases which the data reveal, is mistakenly viewed, by both monetarists
and post-Keynesians alike, as the result of a process of active policy intervention by the central bank. The notion appears to be that the monetary
authorities keep their eyes focused on the state of the economy in general,
and on the level of unemployment in particular.

Instead, Moore argues, the central bank passively validates decisions made
by private creditors.
In fact, the Fed scrutinizes the real economy closely. Take, for example,
the minutes of the December 22, 1992 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee 1993, p. 323)
The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity
was rising appreciably in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, in association with an apparent upturn in wage income and a surge in confidence,
had improved considerably; sizable gains were being registered in the sales
and starts of single-family homes; and business spending for capital equipment remained strong. There also had been solid advances in industrial
output, and private payroll employment had turned up. Data on wages and
prices had been slightly less favorable recently [that is, wages have been
rising, always a danger — D.H.], and on balance they raised the possibility
that the trend toward lower inflation might be slowing a little.

The minutes went on to report detailed observations regarding employment, the average workweek, industrial production, retail sales, business
invesment, construction, and the trade picture. (To give a measure of how
detailed: “sales of heavy trucks rose sharply, and business purchases likely
accounted for some of the recent sizable increase in sales of light trucks;
on the other hand, shipments of complete aircraft were weak.”) All this
discussion of the real economy preceded discussion of financial and monetary affairs, and far exceeded it in volume as well. The central bank runs
a huge economic data generation and analysis apparatus, which confi218

RENEGADES

dently second-guesses official statistics, and, a Fed economist once told
me, frequently prompts corrections that are buried in routine monthly revisions in Commerce and Labor Department data. Every twitch in the statistics is noted and mused over to death.
And those conclusions are based on public releases of the Fed’s minutes. According to Drew University economist Edwin Dickens (personal
communication), who’s read the full transcripts — which are released only
20 years after the fact, and read by almost no one — policymakers are
exceedingly obsessed with wage increases and the state of labor militancy.
They’re not only concerned with the state of the macroeconomy, conventionally defined, they’re also concerned with the state of the class struggle,
to use the old-fashioned language.
When things look too bubbly for the Fed’s satisfaction, it tightens policy,
by lowering its targets for money supply growth and raising its target for
the fed funds rate. In doing so, it hopes to slow down the economy, but
there’s often many a slip between tightening and slowdown. The reason
for this gap was explored nearly 40 years ago by Hyman Minsky (1957) in
a classic paper modestly titled “Central Bank and Money Market Changes.”
Minsky pointed to two innovations of that relatively sleepy time, the federal funds market, which allows aggressive banks to transcend the limits
of their own reserves by borrowing from surplus banks, and the growing
presence of nonfinancial corporations, eager to make money on spare
cash, as providers as well as users of credit. Both were responses to rising
short-term interest rates, which, as Minsky wrote, pushed actors “to find
new ways to finance operations and new substitutes for cash assets.” Market innovations, Minsky stressed, would complicate the work of central
bankers, since tight policy could be partly offset with new instruments.
Innovations, as Minsky (1975, p. 76) later pointed out, allow capital asset
prices to continue rising (and economies to continue expanding) against
the dampening influence of rising interest rates.
Over time, with the proliferation of financial innovations, the “compounded changes will result in an inherently unstable money market so
that a slight reversal of prosperity can trigger a financial crisis,” wrote Minsky
40 years ago. This would require an extension of the central bank safety
net to the entire financial matrix, not merely the commercial banks that
were its legal charges. Fighting inflation might entail a terrible financial
cost, and so the Fed would be forced to err on the side of indulgence
whenever the credit system looked rocky.
Perhaps Minsky was a little early — the first financial crisis of the post219

WALL STREET

1945 period was the credit crunch of 1966 — but he described the mechanism perfectly: first the rising inflation of the 1960s and 1970s, followed
by the Volcker clampdown, which was lifted when it looked like Mexico’s
default would bring the world banking system down. But the Volcker
clampdown required driving interest rates far higher, and for a longer period of time, than anyone would have expected, to shut the economy
down, so creative are the innovators at evading central bank restraints. In
the 1980s and 1990s, innovations proliferated, as interest rates remained
high by historical standards (despite their declining trend). Capital was
mobilized as it hadn’t been in 60 years, as it became clear that while the
poor could expect no indulgence from the new economic order, the rentier
class, some notorious bad apples aside, could count on a blank check.
Of course, Minskian innovations can’t evade the tightening hand of the
central bank forever. Perhaps the most sensible view of the whole matter
was that expressed by a central banker, Alan Holmes (1969, p. 73), then a
senior vice president at the New York Fed, speaking at a time when the
monetarist challenge was marginal but on the rise: “In the real world, banks
extend credit, creating deposits in the process, and look for the reserves
later. The question then becomes one of whether and how the Federal
Reserve will accommodate the demand for reserves. In the very short run,
the Federal Reserve has little or no choice about accommodating that demand; over time, its influence can obviously be felt.” This is a refreshing
antidote both to the mechanistic nostrums of the monetarists and to the
vision of limitless elasticity of the extreme endogeneists like Moore. The
Fed, like all central banks, is mighty, but it is not almighty.
Why does this matter beyond the world of scholarship? If the endogenous money theorists are right — and they are — then money and commerce are inseparable; neutrality is a fantasy. That has several implications.
It locates tendencies towards financial instability and crisis at the heart of
the system, rather than outside it, as Friedman and other state-blamers
would have it. It makes conventional monetary policy more difficult to
manage, since “money” becomes a very slippery thing. And it makes radical reforms more difficult than many populists would like, since policies
aimed at finance aim at a moving target, and one not easily separable from
production, or from ownership.
Marx (1973, p. 126; 1981, p. 674; see also de Brunhoff 1976, pp. 80, 98)
anticipated modern Keynesian endogenists, arguing (against Ricardo and
the classical quantity theorists) that the quantity of money in circulation is
determined by economic activity, and not the other way around. Not the
220

RENEGADES

least of the reasons for this influence is that the extension of credit is such
a short step from simple exchange for money; an IOU can be exchanged
between any agreeable partners, and it’s only a small matter to bring in a
bank to formalize the transaction. This was true even under a gold standard; these spontaneous contracts make the line between money and credit
a porous one, and that explains why the modern money supply is so flexible. Of course, in Marx’s view, these extensions of credit become worthless in a crisis, as everyone scrambles for gold; this kind of crisis hasn’t
been seen in this century, as central banks have learned how to contain
crisis and make short-term government paper seem as good as gold.

Minsky
Of all the modern theorists in the Keynesian tradition, one of the most
interesting is Hyman Minsky, who devoted his career to exploring the
relations between finance and the real world.18 We’ve already looked at
his contribution to theories of monetary endogeneity; the rest of his work
deserves a few more pages.
Following the lead of Keynes’s Treatise, with its separate industrial and
financial spheres, Minsky developed a two-sphere theory of a modern
capitalist economy, one of current output and one for capital assets, which
jointly determine the level of economic activity. Expectations about the
short term determine how much of existing capacity will be used; expectations about the long term determine decisions about whether to expand
capacity. Decisions of the latter sort have consequences over time; managers who make bad investments, and especially those who borrow money
to make them, will suffer losses. If such losses are sustained and widespread, the system faces the risk of deflationary collapse. This analysis is
familiar to a reader of Keynes’s General Theory, but it got lost when Keynes
was domesticated for textbooks and politicians.
A serious problem with Minsky’s analysis, at least when applied to the
modern U.S. economy, is that rather little real investment is financed by
borrowed money. So while borrowing and investment decisions have longterm consequences, they’re not simply two sides of the same coin. In the
U.S. and most other First World economies, investments are overwhelmingly financed internally, through profits. Corporate managers have shown
great reluctance in recent years to commit themselves to long-term investment, for fear of being stuck with useless capacity in a recession; investment has increasingly been skewed to short-lived, quick-payoff equipment.
But during the 1980s, managers were not shy about borrowing; here an221

WALL STREET

other portion of Minsky’s analysis is illuminating. In a taxonomy that can be
applied to individual units, like firms or households, or whole economies,
Minsky (1978; 1986, pp. 207–209) divided financial structures into three
types, hedged, speculative, and Ponzi. A unit with a “hedged” structure is
one that can comfortably service all its debts, interest and principal, out of
current income; a “speculative” unit can meet its interest payments, but
must raise new funds, either through the sale of assets or the extension of
new loans, to pay off principal; and a “Ponzi” unit can’t make its interest
payments, much less pay off principal, without finding fresh cash.19
Economies traverse the hedge–speculative–Ponzi sequence, until a bad
financial accident scares players into prudence, and the cycle starts over
again. In recent American experience, the late 1920s were a time when
the border was crossed from speculative to Ponzi, until the great crash
and subsequent Depression brought the scheme to a disastrous end. That
bout made nearly everyone very debt shy, and the largely excellent performance of the U.S. economy in the 30 years after World War II meant
that firms and households had little need for outside finance. But, Minsky
argued, that kind of Golden Age makes people more complacent, reducing their fear of indebtedness: “stability is destabilizing,” a formulation
sometimes called the Minsky paradox. For a while, this new imprudence
fuels a boom, but with few signs of general financial strain; individual
units, and the whole economy, cross from hedged to speculative financial
structures, as debts are rolled over. The margin of error narrows. While
hedged financial structures are vulnerable to real-world shocks — firms
might face new competition, or households face a period of unemployment — they’re largely immune to financial disturbances. But speculative
units are not only more vulnerable to real-world shocks, they’re vulnerable to financial market troubles as well, since they need new credits to
pay off old principal. If interest rates spike upwards, or credit gets hard to
come by, a speculative unit is in trouble.
While it would be hard to draw a fine historical line, it seems that the
U.S. economy entered the speculative realm sometime in the 1970s, as
financial crises became more prominent features of the business cycle
(Wojnilower 1980; Wolfson 1986). But in every case, the Federal Reserve
stepped in to prevent the financial crisis from becoming generalized; individual institutions might be allowed to go under, but the authorities would
never allow this localized crisis to spread into a broad deflationary collapse. Further, Big Government and its deficit spending put a floor under
the economy, preventing a true cascade of failure from developing. But
222

RENEGADES

“validating threatened financial usages,” in Minsky’s (1986, p. 251) phrase,
only emboldens players for further adventures in leverage on the next up
cycle. And so the indulgence of the 1970s laid the groundwork for the
even more exuberant 1980s, when the U.S. economy unquestionably entered a Ponzi phase. Corporate takeovers were frequently done with the
open admission that the debt could never be comfortably serviced, and
that only with asset sales or divine intervention could bankruptcy be
avoided. Households, too, engaged in similar practices, as balloon mortgages were arranged — that final balloon payment could only be made by
taking out another mortgage as the first one matured.
What does Minsky’s model say about recent history? While the slump
of the early 1990s was clearly the result of a Ponzi structure going sour,
the authorities moved to contain the crisis. Between 1989 and early 1994,
the Fed drove down interest rates hard and kept them there. At the same
time, the U.S. government bailed out the savings and loan industry through
the Resolution Trust Corp., spending $200 billion in public funds. These
moves kept the financial system from utter collapse, but unlike the 1930s,
debts were not written off. Thanks to lower interest rates, debts were easier
to service, but the stock of debt — principal — tells a different story. The
best way to measure this is by comparing the level of debts outstanding
with the incomes that support them. For nonfinancial corporations, total
indebtedness in 1995 was nearly 11 times after-tax profits — an improvement from the over 22 times level of 1986, but still twice the levels of the
1950s and 1960s. For households, the figures show no such improvement:
in 1995, consumer debts were equal to 91% of after-tax income, the highest level since the Fed started collecting such data in 1945, and well above
1980s levels, which were themselves well above 1970s levels.
To use Minsky’s language, the business sector seems to have settled
back from Ponzi to speculative, but households continue to explore fresh
Ponzi territory, with no signs of temperance. One message of these numbers is that the U.S. economy remains very vulnerable to higher interest
rates. “At high enough short term interest rates speculative units become
Ponzi units” (Minsky 1978), and Ponzi units explode.
Minsky emphasized financial factors in causing instability, with the real
mentioned almost as an afterthought. A more balanced interpretation would
say that financial structures are central to the propagation of a general
economic crisis. Any shock to a highly leveraged structure — a business,
household, or national economy — makes it impossible to service debts
that seemed tolerable when they were contracted. For a system-wide cri223

WALL STREET

sis, the shocks are generally of a broad sort — a normal business cycle
recession, capital flight, or a political crisis. For forward-thinking connoisseurs of crisis, one could imagine some ecological crisis causing crop failures or disastrous climate changes, which cause a spike in prices and/or a
collapse in output. Regardless of the cause, a hedged financial structure
might be able to cope with such threats, but a Ponzi couldn’t.
money, mind, and matter: a psychocultural digression
Money is a kind of poetry.
— Wallace Stevens
Who drinks on credit gets twice as drunk.
— Turkish proverb
One virtue of Keynes’s attention to psychology and sentiment is that it
urges us to think about economics in a way that most economists find
squishy and unscientific. This narrowness of vision has harmed the dismal science immeasurably.
Credit is money of the mind, as James Grant (1992) put it in a book title,
though of course every now and then mental money faces an unpleasant
coming to terms with matter. Still, in these days of multibillion-dollar bailouts, it seems that mind can sustain fantastic valuations for far longer than
ever seemed imaginable in the past.
We could date the modern credit culture’s beginning to the severance
of paper currencies from gold in the early 1970s. It waxed during the 1983–
89 binge, waned during the 1989–92 slump, and waxed again starting in
1993. At its root, it’s based on the assumption that a munificent river of
liquidity will flow for all time. Someone will always be willing to take an
overvalued asset off your hands tomorrow at a price comfortably higher
than today’s. Two famous axioms from apostles of credit illustrate this
faith. In the late 1970s, Citibank chair Walter Wriston, a promoter of Third
World lending, rebutted skeptics with the argument that “Countries don’t
go bankrupt” (quoted in Kuczynski 1988, p. 5). The 1980s’ chief
debtmonger, the junk bond supremo Michael Milken, used to argue in the
days before his incarceration that capital isn’t a scarce resource, capital is
abundant — it’s vision that’s scarce (quoted in Bruck 1988, p. 272).
This credit culture is a long way from that described by a 19th century
Scottish banker, G.M. Bell (quoted in Marx 1981, p. 679), who thought his
colleagues to be finer moralists than clerics:

224

RENEGADES

Banking establishments are moral and religious institutions. How often has
the fear of being seen by the watchful and reproving eye of his banker
deterred the young tradesman from joining the company of riotous and
extravagant friends…? Has he not trembled to be supposed guilty of deceit
or the slightest misstatement, lest it should give rise to suspicion, and his
accommodation be in consequence restricted or discontinued [by his
banker]?... And has not that friendly advice been of more value to him than
that of priest?

‘The cult of money,” wrote Marx (1973, p. 232), “has its asceticism, its selfdenial, its self-sacrifice — economy and frugality, contempt for the mundane, temporal, and fleeting pleasures…. Hence the connection between
English Puritanism or also Dutch Protestantism, and money-making.” In a
phrase Keynes also used, it is auri sacra fames — the sacred hunger for gold.
This austerity strikes moderns, saturated with commodities, as quaint
— though there’s nothing passé about sadomonetarist adjustment programs. But there’s another sense in which money and religion travel together — especially when money takes the form of a promise rather than
a hard form of settlement, that is, when money becomes credit (from Latin,
“I believe”). A credit agreement is a profession of faith by both parties:
short of a swindle, both parties believe the debtor will be able to repay the
loan with interest. It is a bet on the future. This theological subtlety is lost
on the information asymmetry theorists, who, even as they concede the
possibility of deception, don’t allow departures from rational self-interest.
For most of history, credit’s dreamier excesses were limited by gold, a
metal at once seen as both “natural money” and pure enough to touch the
body of Christ. Marx (1973, p. 727):
The monetary system [i.e., gold-based] is essentially Catholic, the credit system essentially Protestant.... [T]he monetary existence of commodities has
a purely social existence. It is faith that brings salvation. Faith in money
value as the immanent spirit of commodities, faith in the mode of production and its predestined disposition, faith in the individual agents of production as mere personifications of self-valorizing capital. But the credit
system is no more emancipated from the monetary system as its basis than
Protestantism is from the foundations of Catholicism.

Money conflates the sacred and profane; it’s no accident that U.S. currency confesses that “In God We Trust.”
This conflation of high and low, of matter and spirit, is enough to send
225

WALL STREET

a student of money to Freud. By classical psychoanalysis, money is gold,
and gold is transformed shit, and exchange relations, sublimated rituals of
the anus. Though this is by now a commonplace, readers found this a
rather shocking thesis almost 90 years ago. Freud’s (1908) essay on the
anal character began by noting the coexistence of a trio of features in such
cases: orderliness, obstinacy, and thrift. Freud speculated that this unholy
trinity — hallmarks of the Victorian bourgeois — springs from an infantile
interest in the anus and its products. Orderliness, said Freud, gives “the
impression of a reaction-formation against an interest in what is unclean
and disturbing and should not be part of the body.” Obstinacy represents
the baby’s lingering reluctance to part with stool on command.
And the infantile roots of thrift are perhaps the most interesting of all.
Freud noted the rich associations between money and dirt found in folklore and everyday language. In English, there are expressions like “stinking rich” and “filthy lucre.” In legends, “the gold which the devil gives his
paramours turns into excrement after his departure…. We also know about
the superstition which connects the finding of treasure with defaecation,
and everyone is familiar with the figure of the ‘shitter of ducats’ [a German
idiom for a wealthy spendthrift; we have our goose with its golden eggs,
more fertile than fecal, but emerging from a neighboring bodily region].
Indeed, even according to ancient Babylonian doctrine gold is ‘the faeces
of hell.’” Finally, Freud suggested that “it is possible that the contrast between the most precious substance known to men and the most
worthless…has led to th[e] specific identification of gold with faeces.”
Freud’s early followers — notably Abraham, Ferenczi, and Jones —
trod the anal path blazed by the master. The accumulation of money is a
sublimated urge to retain feces for the very pleasure of it, and the production of commodities is the psychic derivative of the expulsion of feces.
Money, in Ferenczi’s (1976) marvelous phrase, is “nothing other than
odourless, dehydrated filth that has been made to shine.”20
The psychological equivalence of dirt and money is suggested by the
low social status of bankers in premodern times. Using nonfecal reasoning, philosopher of money Georg Simmel (1978, p. 221) speculated that
“the importance of money as a means, independent of all specific ends,
results in the fact that money becomes the center of interest and the proper
domain of individuals and classes who, because of their social position,
are excluded from many kinds of personal and specific goals.” Among
Simmel’s examples are the emancipated Roman and Athenian slaves who
became bankers, as did Armenians in Turkey; Moors in Spain; and Hu226

RENEGADES

guenots, Quakers, and Jews across Europe. Reading Simmel 80 years later,
one thinks how the social prestige of banking increased along with the
development of credit, that is, with its evolving liberation from gold.
Norman O. Brown, not the most fashionable of writers, found Freudian
orthodoxy wanting. He returned the sacred to the analysis of money and
demeaned both equally. For Brown (1985, p. 297), money and the sacred
were both sublimated products of a revulsion from the body. Such sublimation, whether aimed at god or mammon, is “the denial of life and the
body…. The more the life of the body passes into things, the less life there
is in the body, and at the same time the increasing accumulation of things
represents an ever fuller articulation of the lost life of the body.”
To Brown, the exchange relation is imbued with guilt, and the debtor–
creditor relation with sadomasochism. In this, Brown followed Nietzsche,
for whom all religions are “systems of cruelties” and for whom creditors
enjoy “a warrant for and a title to cruelty” (Nietzsche 1967, Second Essay).
(Modern usage confirms the link of debt with both sadomasochism and
the sacred: “bonds” impose conditions known as “covenants” on debtors.) Creditors in the ancient world “could inflict every kind of indignity
and torture upon the body of the debtor; for example, cut from it as much
as seemed commensurate with the size of the debt.” Creditors can take
pleasure in “being allowed to vent [their] power on one who is powerless,
the voluptuous pleasure ‘de faire le mal pour le plaisir de la faire,’ the
enjoyment of violation.” Nietzsche might have enjoyed these pleasures.
For Brown, debt is a sickly tribute paid by the present to the past. (Of
course, we postmoderns often see — consciously or not — credit as a
way to steal from the future.) But for a partisan of the body, Brown was
nonetheless guilty of the ancient psychoanalytic habit of dematerializing
its needs. As the early analyst Paul Schilder (1976) — who rightly lamented
the absence of a psychoanalysis of work — noted, “When one looks over
large parts of the psychoanalytic literature one would not conceive the
idea that one eats because one is hungry and wants food for sustaining
one’s life but one would rather suppose that eating is a sly way of satisfying oral libido…. Silberer once said…[that] according to psychoanalytic
conceptions…the Danube…is merely a projection of urine and birthwater.”
Similarly, Brown’s gold is more a fetishized projection of intrapsychic
drama than an alienated embodiment of social power. His moneyed subjects lack class, race, nationality, and sex. For Marx, gold was valuable because it embodied human labor and served as the universal exchange
equivalent for all other commodities, whose value arises from the labor that
227

WALL STREET

made them. But the nature of market relations — anonymous, mathematical — hides the social nature of production and exchange behind a veil of
money. As psychoanalysis lacks a theory of work, so does orthodox Marxism lack an understanding of the passions that sustain the disguise. With
credit comes a set of passions entirely different from those of gold.
Money, Brown said, is but part of the “commitment to mathematize the
world, intrinsic to modern science.” But modern science has mathematized
money. Aside from doomsayers, survivalists, and other goldbugs, the
monetary functions of dehydrated filth are all but forgotten. Even paper
money is getting scarce — only about 10% of the broadly defined money
supply (M2). Most money now lives a ghostly electronic life.
With this dematerialization of money has come at least a partial banishment of the guilty sadomasochism of the anus. That banishment was seen
at its fullest in the 1980s, when fantasy ruled the financial scene; in the
early 1990s, the repressed made a partial return, but the mid-1990s saw a
relapse of exuberance. But the psychological dethronement, however complete or incomplete, of anality and guilt has an interesting analogue in the
cultural and social transformations that so trouble American reactionaries.
Capitalism, having undermined the authoritarian–patriarchal family, now
produces fewer guilt-ridden obsessives and more hungry narcissists than
it did in the days when gold and daddy reigned as the harsh taskmasters
from whom there was no appeal. Like the narcissist, today’s consumer
seems less interested in the accumulation of possessions than in the (novelty-rich, credit-financed) act of purchase itself.21 Rather than the guilty
obstinacy of the anus — or the Puritan character identified by Max Weber
as the spirit of capitalism — one detects a more primitive, fickle, and eternally dissatisfied orality. In contrast with the dry, tight, fixed, “masculine”
aura of gold, modern credit money seems protean, liquid, and “feminine.”22
Unlike the classic neurotic, whose conflicts centered around anxiety
and guilt over what were seen as dangerous or forbidden desires, the
modern narcissist complains most about a sense of emptiness, of disconnectedness, of a free-floating rage and anxiety attached to nothing in particular. Under a superficially well-functioning veneer, the upscale narcissist,
in Joel Kovel’s (1980) words, “is unable to affirm a unity of project or
purpose, a common goal, with other people in a way that goes beyond
immediacy or instrumentality.”
According to Kovel, the transformations of domestic life that have occurred since the capitalist industrial revolution first gave us the authoritarian–patriarchal–obsessive personality type, only to be succeeded by the
228

RENEGADES

modern, or postmodern, narcissistic type. The breakup of traditional social arrangements that came with the development of the capitalist labor
market meant that the scale of social life expanded — transportation and
communication making people far more mobile and informed about life
beyond their locality — and shrank, as the nuclear family became the
central focus of all non-work life. “Childhood” in the sense of a protected,
privileged phase of life was invented sometime in the 19th century.
This child-centered, father-dominated life became increasingly penetrated, Kovel argued, by the state, the media, and the increasing power
of the commodity form. The family, in Kovel’s coinage, became de-sociated.
People’s lives became increasingly determined by institutions far beyond
their immediate sphere of experience. Decisions about lives in New Jersey are often made by executives in Tokyo; about lives in Brazil made in
Grosse Pointe and Milan. The family has effectively ceased to be a barrier
against outside events, a haven in a heartless world.
A right-wing version of this analysis calls for a return to the patriarchal
family, which is impossible and undesirable. But leaving aside the issues
of the politics of the household, we have to wonder how capitalism can
survive this new personality type. On one hand, the system, especially its
American variant, depends on credit-financed consumption to keep the
wheels spinning, but on the other, the financial system can’t live indefinitely with its consequences. Policymakers can impose sadomonetarism,
but it’s not clear that the system can bear it either economically or psychopolitically over the long term. The attempt to evade the sadomonetarist
logic produces only a bizzarria of hollow prosperity, speculative bubbles,
and an atmosphere of generalized irresponsibility. The attempt to conform to it provokes economic stagnation and corrosive popular resentment. This is another way of looking at the Minsky paradox.
Marx
As James Crotty has said, Keynesians have historically emphasized finance
at the expense of production, and Marxists production at the expense of
finance; many Marxists have treated production as fundamental, and finance as epiphenomenal, a curious replication of orthodoxy.23 While this
is a basically accurate characterization of much of the Marxian tradition,
it’s not really true of Marx himself. Though Marx’s writings on finance are
mostly fragmentary and undeveloped, they are richly suggestive, and it’s
clear he considered it central to his analysis.24
229

WALL STREET

Hilferding’s curse
One of the reasons for the sorry state of Marxian theories of finance —
with the honorable, though recent exception of writers like Crotty, Gerald
Epstein, Robert Fitch, Duncan Foley, David Harvey, Robert Pollin, and the
editors of Monthly Review — is the shadow cast by Rudolf Hilferding and
his Finance Capital. The book contains something obsolete, misleading,
or wrong on almost every page, from minor offenses to major.
Several examples: Hilferding’s (1981, p. 137) claim that changes in interest rates can be “predicted with a high degree of probability” would be
welcome news to bond traders, were it true.25 While the relation between
the stock market and real activity is far from simple, it is preposterous to
argue, as Hilferding did, that production is unaffected by changes in ownership (pp. 135, 141); the M&A boom of the 1980s and 1990s has radically
affected the real world. He mocked the notion that interest payments can
dampen profits, and thereby investment, or that changes in interest rates
have any significant effect on the business cycle (pp. 286–287) — two
notions entirely refuted by modern experience. Probably his greatest mistake, however, was his assertion that industry and finance were becoming
one, the product of this union being the finance capital of the title, and
with it cartels would replace competition and high tariffs would supercede free trade. The “English system” — now known as the Anglo-American system of stock-market centered capitalism — was “outmoded” and
“everywhere on the decline” (p. 293); henceforth, banks would control
the commanding heights. Speculation and financial crises were relegated
to the past, part of the youthful indiscretions of a now-mature capitalism
(pp. 292, 294).26
Of course it would be wrong to view recent history, which has seen the
spread of the Anglo-American system to the Third World, and the undoing
of the bank-centered systems of Germany and Japan, and say that the
future belongs to stock markets. Social analysts have an unfortunate habit
of projecting their own local and recent experience into the universal future. But history has not turned out Hilferding’s way, and there is no evidence right now that time is on his side. The relations between financial
capital and real, between shareholders and manager, though growing ever
closer, are nonetheless extremely complicated; it’s hard to say anything
about them without wanting to say “but…” immediately afterwards.
Hilferding’s errors were more than intellectual — he did real political
damage serving as finance minister of the Social Democratic government

230

RENEGADES

in Germany in 1923 and in 1928–29. Faced with inflation in his first term,
he advocated a return to gold — orthodox, but perhaps understandable, if
unimaginative, in the context of the period’s hyperinflation. His second
term coincided with the great collapse, which drove unemployment from
7% to 30% in a matter of three years. As the collapse unfolded, Hilferding
again advocated austerity — budget cuts and tax increases, while resisting
all “inflationary” schemes (Darity and Horn 1985). While Hilferding obviously can’t be blamed for the collapse, his loyalty to capitalist financial
orthodoxy — what Keynes derided in Britain as “the Treasury view” — is
inexcusable in a socialist, and further proof that in practical matters,
Marxians can be as blinkered as the most austere Chicagoan.

money and power
Several aspects of Marx’s theorizing on money and credit are worth savoring: the inseparability of money and commerce, the political nature of
money (and the inseparability of market and state), and the role of credit
in breaking capital’s own barriers to accumulation.
Unlike mainstream economics, which has a hard time joining theories
of money to theories of production, the two are inseparable in Marx. Production is always for profit, and exchange is always for money, and the
existence of money presupposes and embodies the whole set of capitalist
social relations. This is important not only in the strictly “economic” sense
but as is always the case in Marx, also the broadly political sense as well.
“The individual carries his social power, as well as his bond with society,
in his pocket” (Marx 1973, p. 157). Words like “power” and “bond” are not
seen in mainstream economics texts.
Behind the illusions of the market as “a very Eden of the innate rights
of man…the exclusive realm of Freedom, Equality, Property, and Bentham”
(Marx 1977, p. 280) lie harsher realities. Money, far from being the neutral
lubricant of classical theory, or the politically neutralizable one of Keynesian
theory, is fundamentally about compulsion and command: capitalists who
can’t turn their products into cash go under (or in these more indulgent
days, file for reorganization), and workers who can’t turn their labor into
cash will starve. As Negri (1991, p. 23) said in one of his less opaque
moments, “[M]oney has only one face, that of the boss.” Or as Martin
Scorsese put it, talking about his movie Casino, “The more gold, the more
blood. The more you show the money, you have to show the blood”
(Weinraub 1995).27 What is true for Scorsese and Negri is rarely true for
orthodox economics; it invents models that hide the blood and the boss.
231

WALL STREET

In this deeply political role, as one of the fundamental mechanisms of
social organization under capitalism, money and credit not only drive competition between capitals and force workers to work or die, they also regulate the affairs of whole governments and countries. Marx emphasized
that despite the fantasies of libertarians, who dream of stateless monies
like gold, money has to be guaranteed by a state, and credit supervised by
one. Money is purely conventional; there’s nothing intrinsically magic about
gold or Federal Reserve notes. The various forms of money are valuable
because people agree they are, and some forceful monopolist — a central
bank and a national Treasury — has to be the ultimate guarantor of agreement, or convention would dissolve.28
Credit, too, is an important form of social coercion; mortgaged workers
are more pliable — less likely to strike or make political trouble. And they
need money to live; nearly everyone below the upper middle class is just
a few paychecks from insolvency. Any state-sponsored action that lessens
the sting of starvation’s discipline — unemployment insurance, minimum
wages, employment guarantees — is possible only when the working class
is strong, and in turn strengthens the class politically; capital passionately
wants to maximize the naked rule of money. Even a tight labor market is a
threat to discipline, which is why industrialists as well as bankers worry
when the unemployment rate gets too low. Some loyal Keynesians, even
after having lived through the last 20 years, in which the rule of money
has been sharpened, still refuse to concede these points.

money and crisis
Just because production and money can’t easily be separated doesn’t mean
they’re identical. In fact, Marx anticipated Keynes in seeing the separation
of production and sale as the root of possible crisis — and in treating this
as an explicit rejection of Say’s law. Money brings in time and the possibility of hoarding: time, because a good is usually sold some time after it is
made, running the risk that its sale price could fall below the cost of its
production, wiping out the capitalist’s expected profit, and hoarding because income need not be spent but may merely be kept idle, since money
is a uniquely “imperishable commodity” (Marx 1973, pp. 149, 198–200).
Pure paper and bank money did perish in 19th century crises, so for
Marx the most imperishable form of money was gold. In a normal, modern crisis, the flight to money is usually to Treasury bills; but even in modern crises, gold, ridiculed by Keynes as a “barbarous relic,” usually regains
its charms. In the Third World, a panic can take the form of a flight from
232

RENEGADES

the domestic currency, not into gold, but into U.S. dollars. Economies with
currencies in collapse often have a whole second set of dollar prices, though
it’s usually the affluent who have access to greenbacks.
The precise meaning of a cash hoard is not as clear as it might seem.
For Keynes, capital kept as money rather than being put into long-term
instruments like stocks and bonds was hoarded. But most moderns hoard
by parking their money in some short-term instrument like a money market fund or Treasury bills. Therefore, what the hoarder means not to spend
still finds its way into the financial circulation, which may end up funding
GM’s working capital or the Pentagon’s purchase of infrared binoculars.
Conversely, money spent buying stocks or bonds almost exclusively goes
to the previous holders rather than their issuing firms. Clearly, though, the
more money that enters the financial circulation, the less is spent on actual goods, thereby increasing the risk of commodities going unsold.
Those complications aside, a reluctance on the part of buyers to part
with their funds can bring about a contraction in an economy, and it’s the
existence of money (and developed financial markets) that makes it possible for players to retire easily and safely from goods markets.
Just as money can’t be separated from production or exchange, neither
can credit be fully severed from the “real” economy, appearances of their
independence to the contrary. “A reciprocal effect takes place here. The
development of the production process expands credit, while credit in
turn leads to an expansion of industrial and commercial operations” (Marx
1981, p. 612). This is true in several senses: businesses borrow to finance
capital expenditures or buy other companies; businesses borrow to buy
raw materials and parts; businesses extend credit to their customers (trade
credit); and individuals borrow to buy consumption goods. All these forms
of credit stretch the limits of both production and consumption beyond
what current incomes alone could have managed.
Besides these needs from the borrowing side, there is also the need of
capitalists and rentiers to deploy their money profitably; these surpluses, which
emerge from production, drive the supply of credit. The credit system makes
all forms of capital fungible; it lubricates the transition of every form of wealth
into its most wonderfully liquid form, money — “the material representative
of general wealth” (Marx 1973, p. 233) — and makes it possible for money,
sterile in itself, to be transformed into profit-seeking capital. From this point
of view, both sides of the argument between neoclassicals and Keynesians
about whether savings precedes investment or vice versa seem reciprocally
incomplete; the two activities depend on each other.
233

WALL STREET

Marxists and other theorists of underconsumption have long pointed
to the limited buying power of the masses as a perpetual flaw of capitalism. “The ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty
and restricted consumption of the masses, in the face of the drive of capitalist production to develop the productive forces as if only the absolute
consumption capacity of society set a limit to them” (Marx 1973, p. 615).
Though it’s not often theorized as such, consumer credit can be thought
of as a modern instance of credit’s assistance to capital in breaking the
barriers to its expansion. Where Marx (1973, p. 613) said that credit to
producers stretches their capacity “irrespective of the limits of consumption,” consumer credit stretches the limits of consumption — and provides lenders with yet another chance to earn interest on cash that might
otherwise have gone idle.
Credit does this mighty work of limit-stretching by pushing firms and
households into fundamentally unsustainable positions — transforming
them into Ponzi units, in Minsky’s taxonomy. At some point, a shock to
the system makes debts unserviceable, and then, as they say on Wall Street,
it’s revealed that leverage is as powerful on the downside as it is on the
upside. While it’s imprecise to say that credit “causes” such a crisis — the
“shock” is usually some interruption of incomes for the indebted units —
the credit system is at the center of any crisis’ onset and propagation. In
the 19th century and into the early 20th, crises were typically marked by
“panics” — financial crashes that metastasized throughout the economy,
leading to extended depressions. The most recent, and quite possibly final, example of this was the 1929 stock market crash, which marked the
opening of capitalism’s greatest crisis, the Great Depression. Popular explanations sometimes name the crash as the “cause” of the Depression,
while allegedly more sophisticated explanations deny the relation. But
the crash is best seen as the opening movement of the broader crisis —
the unraveling of a monstrously leveraged financial structure. Credit had
served to push stocks to unsustainably high levels; it had also allowed
production to expand capacity beyond the limits of consumption. The
crash exposed these limits, announced the unsustainability of promises to
pay, and rendered investments unprofitable and debts unserviceable. A
Fisher deflation was underway.
Of course, we don’t have Fisher deflations today; we have expensive
bailouts, and not just in the U.S. Actually, the recent U.S. bank and S&L
bailouts were rather modest in comparison to disasters elsewhere. Estimates are that the combined losses and rescue costs in the U.S. disaster
234

RENEGADES

were about 3% of a year’s GDP — compared with 4% for Norway’s bank
crisis, 6% for Sweden’s, 8% for Finland’s (all from the late 1980s and early
1990s), and, the world champion, 17% for Spain’s (which ran from 1977 to
1985). Altogether, about two-thirds of IMF member countries experienced
some sort of credit disaster between 1980 and 1996. Such disasters may
have been successfully contained, but that doesn’t mean they’re insignificant or rare. In fact, some analysts argue that the banking disasters of the
last quarter-century are historically unprecedented in both frequency and
size (Goldstein and Turner 1996).
There is an important exception to the rule that generalized collapses
no longer happen. As Penny Ciancanelli (1992) nicely put it, during the
debt crisis of the 1980s the First World banks got a Minsky bailout while
the Third World suffered a Fisher deflation. Domestic banking crises in
Third World countries over the last decade or two have been far more
intense than in the First, with losses ranging from 10% to 25% of GDP.
Those countries, however, were unable to mount the kinds of rescue operations seen in the North, and their economies have, in many cases, suffered depressions, sparked and propagated in the classic Fisher manner.
But the experience of successful First World bailouts shows that Marx
(1981, p. 621) badly underestimated the power of the state when he said
that crises could not be avoided by “allowing one bank, e.g. the Bank of
England, to give all the swindlers the capital they lack in paper money
and to buy all the depreciated commodities at their old nominal values.”
Central banks and governments need not go that far; prudential supervision (forgotten in the 1980s, but more or less remembered in the 1990s,
with the occasional exception) and multibillion dollar rescue packages
have done their work.
Still, credit has made it possible for expansions to exceed what would
otherwise have been their natural limits, and the threat of crisis arose when
those limits became clear. The S&L disaster ripened (leaving aside the pure
swindling, the yacht parties with their cocaine and call girls, the thrift presidents stealing money to expand their personal art collections, etc.) when
it became clear that the shopping centers and condos that were built on its
lines of credit proved economically pointless; the junk bond crisis ripened when the corporate buyouts and restructuring that junk originally
financed were revealed as the Ponzi units they were. Money of the mind
had an uncomfortable collision with matter. But thanks to the Resolution
Trust Corp. and Alan Greenspan, these crises never became generalized,
unlike their ancestors 60 years earlier. No one can proclaim that it will
235

WALL STREET

work this way forever, but so far, this has to be counted a major innovation in the state management of capitalism. It may be that the slow rot that
has characterized the U.S. economy over the last 25 years — low levels of
investment and productivity growth and the decline in real wages — is
the system’s subtle revenge on its political saviors. But it would be wrong,
at least by Marx’s lights, to call that rot a crisis, since “permanent crises do
not exist” (Marx 1968, p. 497).

credit, consciousness, and beyond
What are we to make socially and politically of the facts that the financial
markets have so marginal a role in guiding production in advanced economies, and that the stock market’s influence on real investment is thankfully minimal? It’s that rentiers serve little social role beyond their own
enrichment. As Marx (1963, p. 212) said, rentiers, like paupers, live only
on the revenue of the country; from an economic point of view they are
equally unproductive; rentiers are simply “respectable paupers.”29
Marx (1981, pp. 483–484) also quoted Ramsay approvingly as saying
that as a country gets richer it produces rentiers, and “in old and rich countries, the amount of national capital belonging to those who are unwilling
to take the trouble of employing it themselves, bears a larger proportion
to the whole productive stock of society, than in newly settled and poorer
districts.” Marx thought this growing accretion of rentier wealth would
depress interest rates over the long term, but this seems not to be the case.
But it has come to dominate the capitalist world-picture. Money, “the
god among commodities,” becomes the principal object of greed — greed
in its most general form, for wealth itself, rather than more specific obsessions, “for clothes, weapons, jewels, women, wine, etc.”30 Certainly 19th
century magnates loved their money, but they also took pride in the physical capital they owned — steel mills and transcontinental railroads. Such
obsessions now seem quaint; modern tycoons love their portfolios most
of all. Interest-bearing capital, Marx (1971, pp. 454–539) wrote, is the most
fetishistic form of all, capital par excellence, with profit (interest) appearing with no more than the mere passage of time, with no apparent engagement with production: money-bearing becomes characteristic of
capital “just as growth is characteristic of trees.”
While this progression from industrial to rentier dominance seems to
prevail on the global level, it’s especially visible when one looks at the
history of individual countries and the movement of capitalism’s center of
gravity: from the Netherlands to Britain to the U.S. and towards Asia. The
236

RENEGADES

speed of this evolution seems to have accelerated, with Japan evolving
from master industrialist to rentier nation in little more than a generation.
In higher rentier consciousness, production disappears from view. This
is apparent not only in ruling-class thinking, but even among its supposed
critics. Many postmodern cultural theorists, for whom class is an obsolete
concept left over from when production mattered most, see the world as
one of identities and desires formed and expressed in the sphere of consumption. “Capital,” complained Andrew Ross (1988, quoted in Hawkes,
1996, p. 8), “or rather our imaginary of Capital, still belongs for the most
part to a demonology of the Other. This is a demonology that inhibits
understanding and action as much as it artificially keeps alive older forms
of ressentiment that have little or no purchase on postmodern consumer
society.”31 Capital becomes fictive, a product of imagination rather than a
real social relation; all antagonism disappears, and money becomes not a
form of coercion, but a realm of desire, even of freedom. This is
unsurprising coming from capital’s house intellectuals, but it seems to infect even its opponents. Forms meant to disseminate these mystifying temptations — the media, advertising, PR — become the principal objects of
study in themselves, overshadowing relations of property and power.
Immateriality simplifies the work of apologists, as it complicates that of
critics. Interest-bearing capital is a “godsend” to bourgeois economists,
who yearn to represent capital as an independent source of value in production — which therefore earns its profit just as workers earn their wages.
Interest, especially in its compounded form, “appears as a Moloch demanding the whole world as a sacrifice belonging to it of right, whose
legitimate demands, arising from its very nature, are however never met
and are always frustrated by a mysterious fate” (Marx 1971, p. 456). But
reformers who aim to transform or abolish credit “without touching upon
real capitalist production [are] merely attacking one of its consequences.”
Interest-bearing capital is a distillation of capital as a social form, not some
phenomenon above or apart from it. Therefore, abolishing interest and
interest-bearing capital, Marx (1971, p. 472) argued, “means the abolition
of capital and of capitalist production itself.”
Capitalism without interest may be impossible, but credit and interest
predated capitalism; usury, and prohibitions against it, are ancient. Usury
came to dominate the feudal order, bleeding it of wealth and hastening its
demise, but under capitalism, Marx (1971, p. 531) argued, credit is subordinated to production. That looks less true now; the needs of money seem
increasingly to take precedence over those of production. This is seen
237

WALL STREET

most visibly in the shift of policy-making in the rich countries from the
stimulation of growth to its suppression in the name of holding down
inflation. Instead of acting as a stimulus to production, the credit system
— the preservation of paper values — looks increasingly like a barrier.
It would be wrong, though, to attribute this just to a mood swing among
the policy-making class. As economies mature, rentier wealth accumulates; family enterprises become public companies, and fortunes become
severed from their roots. On the capital markets:
All particular forms of capital, arising from its investment in particular spheres
of production or circulation, are obliterated…. It exists in the undifferentiated, self-identical form of independent value, of money…. Here capital
really does emerge, in the pressure of its demand and supply, as the common capital of the class…. [It appears] as a concentrated and organized
mass, placed under the control of the bankers as representatives of the
social capital in a quite different manner to real production (Marx 1981, pp.
490–491; emphasis in original).

The modern owning class is formed in large part through the creation and
trading of standardized claims on the wealth and labor of others.
What do such owners contribute? In what Marx knew as a joint-stock
company, and we know as the modern large corporation, not much. Unlike classical capitalists, who ran the operation and thus earned something like a wage of superintendence along with a share of the profits,
today’s managers are paid a (high) wage of superintendence, while the
profits go mainly to outsiders. Of course that high managerial wage, even
if it takes the form of a paycheck, still has to be considered mainly a share
of profits. But the lion’s share goes to outside stockholders and creditors.
It’s tempting to bemoan this relation as parasitical, which it is, but that’s
not all. “The social form of capital devolves on interest, but expressed in a
neutral or indifferent form; the economic function of capital devolves on
profit of enterprise, but with the specifically capitalist character of this
function removed” (Marx 1981, pp. 506–507). That is, rentiers receive their
share of profits in what feels like interest, even if their literal form is dividends with little trace of its origins (since dividends appear as the return
that capital earns simply with the passage of time), and the managers run
firms as professional supervisors — as workers (even if more royally paid
than in Marx’s day) rather than owners.32 The classic 19th century apology
for capital, which held profit to be the wages of superintendence, has
long been undermined. In the late 20th century, the social role of functionless owners is rarely investigated, but their case is hardly compelling.
238

RENEGADES

Modern bosses are paid monstrous salaries; one study, by Pearl Meyer
& Partners Inc., found that CEOs of big firms earned 212 times what the
average U.S. worker did in 1995, compared with a mere 44 times in 1965
(Duff 1996). But their role as managers doesn’t require these vast sums;
they’re paid that well just because they can get away with it. And with the
growth of professional managers working for distant shareholders, “the
capitalist vanishes from the production process as someone superfluous.”
Cooperatives show, Marx said, that workers could hire managers as easily
as do the owners of capital (Marx 1981, pp. 511–512).
The growth of credit allowed entrepreneurs with no capital, whether
skilled, unskilled, or felonious, to use the capital of others. Previsioning
Donald Trump, whose net worth was held together in the 1980s in part by
slick, publicist-generated magazine articles about how rich and successful
he was, Marx wrote: “The actual capital that someone possesses, or is
taken to possess by public opinion, now becomes simply the basis for a
superstructure of credit.” Previsioning modern pension fund managers,
who appropriate workers’ savings and run them largely in their own interest, paying themselves grandly in the process, he wrote: “What the speculating trader risks is social property, not his own. Equally absurd now is
the saying that the origin of capital is saving, since what this speculator
demands is precisely that others should save for him” (Marx 1981, p. 570).
The chain of displaced responsibilities that characterize modern corporate capitalism, Marx argued, was essential both to its development and
the development of better possibilities.
But within the capitalist system itself, this expropriation takes the antithetical form of the appropriation of social property by a few; and credit gives
these few ever more the character of simple adventurers. Since ownership
now exists in the form of shares, its movement and transfer become simply
the result of stock-exchange dealings, where little fishes are gobbled up by
the sharks, and sheep by the stock-exchange wolves. In the joint-stock system, there is already a conflict with the old form, in which the means of
social production appear as individual property. But the transformation into
the form of shares still remains trapped within the capitalist barriers; instead of overcoming the opposition between the character of wealth as
something social, and private wealth, this transformation only develops this
opposition in a new form…. Without the factory system that arises from the
capitalist mode of production, cooperative factories could not develop. Nor
could they do so without the credit system that develops from the same

239

WALL STREET

mode of production. This credit system, since it forms the principal basis
for the gradual transformation of capitalist private enterprises into capitalist
joint-stock companies, presents in the same way the means for the gradual
extension of cooperative enterprises on a more or less national scale. Capitalist joint-stock companies as much as cooperative factories should be
viewed as transition forms from the capitalist mode of production to the
associated one, simply that in the one case the opposition is abolished in a
negative way, and in the other in a positive way (Marx 1981, pp. 571–572)

At the beginning of this excerpt, Marx seemed to be writing about the
formation of modern corporations in the mid-19th century, a time of Robber Barons, scam artists, and financial panics — a process being repeated
today in the so-called emerging markets of the Third World. In the First
World, things are a bit more regularized now. But Marx’s essential point is
that corporations represent proof that the mechanisms of social production are separable from the structure of ownership. In other words, the
modern corporation shows that production can be organized on a large
scale over time and space, bringing together thousands of workers in phenomenally productive cooperation. But these institutions are nonetheless
run by and for a small group of owners and managers whose social role is
peripheral or even harmful to the institution’s proper running. This contradiction, in Marx’s words, constitutes “the latent abolition of capital ownership contained within it” (Marx 1981, p. 572).
Capitalist ownership had thus become socially useless at the same time
corporate capitalism had created a powerful organizational form. Indeed,
this very separation of ownership and management, made possible by the
joint-stock company and stimulated by the development of modern credit
markets, had become a powerful motor of growth:
[Credit is] the principal lever of overproduction and excessive
speculation…because the reproduction process, which is elastic by nature,
is now forced to its most extreme limit; and this is because a great part of
the social capital is applied by those who are not its owners, and who therefore proceed quite unlike owners who, when they function themselves,
anxiously weigh the limits of their private capital. This only goes to show
how the valorization of capital founded on the antithetical character of capitalist production permits actual free development only up to a certain point,
which is constantly broken through by the credit system. The credit system
hence accelerates the material development of the productive forces and
the creation of the world market, which it is the historical task of the capi240

RENEGADES

talist mode of production to bring to a certain level of development, as
material foundations for new forms of production. At the same time, credit
accelerates the violent outbreaks of this contradiction, crises, and with these
the elements of dissolution of the old mode of production…. The credit
system has a dual character immanent in it: on the one hand it develops the
motive of capitalist production, enrichment by the exploitation of others’
labour, into the purest and most colossal system of gambling and swindling, and restricts ever more the already small number of the exploiters of
social wealth; on the other hand however it constitutes the form of transition towards a new mode of production. It is this dual character that gives
the principal spokesmen for credit, from Law through to Isaac Péreire, their
nicely mixed character of swindler and prophet (ibid., pp. 572–573).

Modern anticorporate antiglobalizers — like people in and around the
San Francisco-based International Forum on Globalization (Henwood
1996a; 1996b) — seem not to appreciate any of these virtues of capitalist
socialization, and have no sense of how to organize social production on
any reasonable scale.33 Big multinationals may be too large on social and
political grounds, if not economic ones, but there’s no way to sustain an
industrial society without something like the corporate form.
Marx’s view that corporate capitalism has made possible its own transcendence, by organizing production on a large and sustained scale and
simultaneously rendering its owners socially vestigial, has gone somewhat
out of fashion, to put it mildly, but is sorely worth recovering. In the light
of his interpretation of the corporation as containing the seeds of a
postcapitalist future, an analysis of that institutional form is in order — in
the interests not only of understanding but also of transformation.

typically dismiss what Joan Robinson called “bastard Keynesianism” — the revisions of
Keynes’s thought that gutted its more radical content, reducing it to a mere tool for
countering the business cycle — particularly the notion of boosting the budget deficit
through tax cuts and/or spending increases to fight a recession. Post-Keynesians place
great emphasis on financial instability and the importance of uncertainty in keeping
investment below the level that would guarantee full employment. Post-Keynesians
don’t believe that capitalist economies tend automatically toward optimal outcomes;
instead, markets often fail, prices don’t necessarily give the right signals to participants,
and the best plans are often frustrated by surprises that come with the passage of time.
By contrast, mainstream neoclassical economists believe that markets always clear (that
is, supply and demand always balance, leaving neither buyers nor sellers unsatisfied),
prices give accurate signals, and time is of little theoretical interest except maybe in the
short term. Though generally left-of-center, post-Keynesians range from those like Paul
Davidson, who are strongly pro-capitalist, through social democrats and, at the extreme, to economists who combine Keynesian theories of finance with a Marxian analysis
of production and a hostility to capitalism as a system. The latter trace their pedigree to
Michal Kalecki; other ur-figures include Nicholas Kaldor and Joan Robinson. Davidson
insists on spelling it “Post Keynesian.” He said (personal communication) this was to
distinguish his brand of thought from the “brand of neoclassical synthesis Keynesianism”
that Paul Samuelson was calling post-Keynesian in the 1970s. The hyphen’s absence,
said Davidson, is “a matter of product differentiation.” Even Davidson, however, is
regarded as outré by the mainstream of the economics profession. For a brief overview, see Holt (1996).
Fixed capital consists mainly of machinery and buildings; working capital, of materials
in the process of production; and liquid capital, of inventories (Keynes CW V, p. 116).
Note that interest rates affect only investment goods markets. Keynes, accurately reflecting the practice of his time, said that borrowing to finance consumption was so
“uncommon” that it could be safely neglected (CW V, p. 238). But now it reads like a
memoir of an innocent time. In the first quarter of 1996, consumer credit in the U.S.,
excluding mortgages, totaled $1.1 trillion, and home mortgage debt, $3.4 trillion —
amounts that could never be ignored, theoretically or practically.
When I presented a version of this argument at a Grant’s Interest Rate Observer conference in 1994, Sir Alan Walters, a Thatcher intimate who was in the audience, objected
strenuously to my choice of monetary aggregate — what corresponds to the U.S. M2.
“No no no!,” he exclaimed; “you should have used Sterling M0!” A medieval theologian
could have done no better. A review of some major empirical studies of the relation
between money growth and inflation by the Bank for International Settlements (Gerlach
1995) showed that most of the tales of money causing inflation are the result of including countries with very high rates of inflation; when those are eliminated, the relation
all but disappears. In most cases, extreme inflation is associated with gigantic budget
deficits financed by the central bank’s printing money, typically in response to some
extreme condition like war or social collapse — in other words, cases of little relevance
to normal situations in the rich industrial countries.
Of course there are many rates of interest in the real world, dependent on the maturity
of a loan and the perceived riskiness of a borrower. Speaking of “the” rate of interest is
merely shorthand for the constellation of rates in effect at a given moment. Keynes’s
use of MEC is rhetorically interesting; one wonders if he preferred the technocratic
term because it avoids the unpleasant class associations of “profits.”
It is almost a law of the social sciences that the virtue of anything called “natural” is that
it preserves the status quo. Riffing on Wicksell’s concept of the natural interest rate,
Milton Friedman introduced the idea of nature to unemployment. In his 1967 presiden-

tial address to the American Economic Association — his presidency was an early sign
of the profession’s rightward move out of Bastard Keynesianism towards
sadomonetarism — he argued that if the authorities pushed unemployment below its
natural rate, inflation would be inevitable (Friedman 1968b; Pesaran 1992).
Or as they say on Wall Street, during a bull market, cash is trash.
The description applies to many markets, not just stocks. What reasonable tales have
the gyrations in oil prices over the last 25 years told? Were the long-term prospects of
oil any different at $30 a barrel from $3? Do any of these prices tell us that oil is a finite
resource that will asphyxiate us if we burn all the crude that lies underground?
And of course it would be the worst sort of vulgar Marxism to attribute Bentham’s
emergence and influence to the needs of the evolving competitive market system.
By monetary crank I mean someone who believes that the major problems of capitalism are the result of debt and interest, ignoring the overriding importance of profit, and
instead holding that if you fix finance everything else will fall into place.
The idea must of been all over Paris in the early 1970s. In The Mirror of Production,
Baudrillard (1975) made a very similar argument.
One of the leading post-Keynesians, Paul Davidson (personal communication) responded to my assertion that the decline in real business investment was caused by the
decline in corporate profitability by saying that the decline in profitability was the result of bad monetary policy.
Both Freud’s and Keynes’s theorizing was transformed by bourgeois society into techniques of adjustment: psychoanalysis became a branch of mental hygiene, and
Keynesianism part of a toolbox for business cycle management.
There was a lively exchange on this topic on the Post Keynesian Thought (PKT) computer network involving Paul Davidson, Randall Wray, and many others including me
in the spring of 1995. It’s on the PKT archive, <http://csf.colorado.edu/mail/pkt/

This paragraph elides the distinction between money and credit, as I’ve done several
times throughout this book. In the narrowest sense, money is the instrument used for
the final settlement of debts. In a world where gold is considered the only real money
and everything else — from paper money to the most exotic financial instrument — is
credit, the distinction is pretty firm. But in a world where gold is a relic and paper and
electronic transactions prevail, then the distinction is very hard to preserve. We think of
dollar bills as money, but they are an obligation of the Federal Reserve, backed, if you
can call it that, by the Fed’s assets, which are mainly U.S. Treasury bonds. Currency
accounts for only about a third of M1, the narrowest definition of the money supply in
U.S. practice; checking accounts are responsible for most of the balance, but checks
are fundamentally a credit instrument, since the recipient has to assume they’re not
made of rubber. Classically, most forms of money in developed capitalist economies
represent liabilities of the banking system — some form of deposit or other — or instruments, like money market funds, that are analogous to bank deposits. To hardmoney nuts, this is surreal, but their view of gold as the essence of money still depends
on a social convention, an act of faith not unlike credit. At a slightly higher level of
sophistication, goldbugs love the metal because it’s the only form of money that doesn’t
depend on the creation of debt, but if it weren’t for debt, capitalist economies would
never have grown as dramatically as they have. Debt is more fundamental to capitalism
than gold.
As I was making final corrections on this book, Minsky died. This was a great loss. It’s
hard to think of another economist who contributed as much in the decades after World
War II, and with as little recognition.

which promised huge returns to investors — but could pay off the first round of plungers only with money taken in from a second round, the second from the third, and so
on. Sooner or later you run out of new suckers, and the whole thing crashes down.
Mainstream economists sometimes object to Minsky’s use of the term as inappropriate
to something as serious as corporate finance, but it seems exactly right to me.
Anyone who has observed modern goldbugs knows that behind their faith often lies a
deep snobbery, a contempt for “common,” debased forms of money like paper, which
lack the aristocratic status of the sacred metal. Economically, they love the austere,
punishing regime of a gold standard, which makes mass prosperity difficult, and hate
loose money, which threatens to make prosperity more widespread than it should be.
Though there is an economic point to this, the psychosocial truth is another matter
entirely; while gold is certainly rarer than feces, both are undifferentiated substances;
an ingot is as characterless as a turd. But, as Fenichel (1945, p. 281) wrote, the anal
characters who love money love the kind that appears to be “not deindividualized;
they love gold and shining coins.”
Or as the Slits put it in their 1979 song “Spend, Spend, Spend”: “I need something new/
Something trivial will do/I need to satisfy this empty feeling.”
Needless to say, the gender contrast alludes to convention, not to timeless essences.
Even a Marxist as admirable as Anwar Shaikh (1995) takes a very fundamentalist view
of finance. To Shaikh, the volatility of stock returns is not a function of Shiller-like
overreaction, but is an accurate reflection of real-sector developments — specifically,
the marginal profitability of new corporate investments. When questioned, Shaikh says
that the direction of influence is only one way, from the real to the financial, with the
financial side having no significant effect on the real at all. Shaikh is unable to provide
a mechanism that explains this determination other than a notion of “turbulent arbitrage”; he can estimate marginal profitability, but no real investors compute it the way
he does. It’s likely that his model is simply capturing the same business cycle and
interest rate effects that link stock markets and the real world; in fact, his measure is not
unlike Wall Street estimates of the next quarter’s profits — though of course the analysts do theirs ahead of the fact, and economists after it. Further, his “discovery” hardly
undermines the notion that stock markets overreact to short-term data — quite the
contrary, it confirms it in a roundabout way.
One example of this centrality: “I exclude Sismondi from my historical survey here
because a critique of his views belongs to a part of my work dealing with the real
movement of capital (competition and credit) which I can only tackle after I have finished this book” (Marx 1971, p. 53).
Not only is this empirical nonsense, it’s un-Marxian. Unlike commodity exchange, argued Marx, which is ultimately regulated by the law of value — the relative labor time
embodied in commodities — the rate of interest is regulated only by market competition (though broadly conceived, allowing for the influence of tradition, culture, and
central bank policy). And, when it is “competition as such that decides, the determination is inherently accidental, purely empirical, and only pedantry or fantasy can seek to
present this accident as something necessary” (Marx 1981, p. 485).
No list of his most embarrassing moments can omit his prediction, uttered days before
Hitler’s appointment to the Chancellorship, that the Nazis would never take power
(Darity and Horn 1985).
This sense of money is snuffed by remarks like those of Duncan Foley, in his introduction to de Brunhoff’s (1976, p. viii) Marx on Money: “Marx’s writings on money remain
in a ‘pre-model’ stage, and it will be necessary for us to bring this theoretical position to
the point of exact expression in a series of models.” Why ever must we do this? How
would it offer any more illumination than the Grundrisse’s prose? Would it make it a

“Marxian” model if one included a dummy variable for the boss’s face, and another for
the spillage of blood?
Recall that even during the days of the high gold standard in the 19th century, the
ultimate regulator of the system was the Bank of England, with the British Navy always
lurking in the background.
Marx opposed revenue to capital; capital is a kind of cash flow that returns a profit, but
revenue doesn’t. From the employers’ point of view, a wage paid to a productive worker
is a form of capital, since the worker creates more in value for the capitalist than he or
she pays out in the wage; from the boss’s point of view, a worker is a profitable investment. (If this sounds harsh, blame capitalism, not Marx.) But paupers and rentiers produce nothing in return for their income; they simply consume, without contributing a
profit or a product in return.
Many postmodernists are skeptical about speaking of capitalism as a system. But in its
role as the general form of wealth, and in its “political” role as emphasized by Negri,
money is the institution that renders — in its violent, reductive, yet seductive way — all
the fragments into exchangeable parts of a single system, be the fragments commodities, services, bits of nature, even lives themselves.
Ross seems to have evolved away from this position, with his more recent interest in
the sweatshop reality behind the glitz of the fashion industry.
Actually, Marx also anticipated the Michael Jensen critique of bloated managements
swindling shareholders out of their rightful booty: “over and above the actual managing director, a number of governing and supervisory boards arise, for which management and supervision are in fact a mere pretext for the robbery of shareholders…”
(Marx 1981, p. 514).
The IFG is funded by foundations sponsored by Doug Tompkins, the co-founder of
Esprit Clothing. Tompkins made his fortune in precisely the sorts of Third World and
domestic sweatshops his Forum now denounces. Tompkins’ Foundation for Deep Ecology — which ironically owns stock in Telefonos de Mexico, Allstate, Citicorp, and WalMart — has the most Malthusian reputation in the green funding world, not a place
known for hostility to the Parson.

Governance

If money is an instrument of control, then financial markets are a lot more
than the institutional matchmakers for saving and investment. You can
see that clearly by looking at how an owning class’s power is asserted
over corporations and governments through financial mechanisms.
governing corporations
[T]he modern corporation may be regarded not simply as one
form of social organization but potentially (if not yet actually) as
the dominant institution of the modern world…. Where its own
interests are concerned, it even attempts to dominate the state.
— Adolph A. Berle and Gardiner C. Means, The Modern
Corporation and Private Property
Marx was right; the separation of the unitary capitalist into the rentier and
manager was an important innovation in the history of capitalism. Surprisingly few economists since have given the matter much thought.
Given the vast powers of big business, how firms are run is of great
interest to almost everyone. But in American public speech, consideration
of the firm and how it’s run is confined to a fairly narrow circle of specialists in the professional and businesses press.1 So restricted, the debate
takes on the quality of a family fight within capital. For example, writing
in the Harvard Business Review, a place where academic theory meets
real business practice, one of the gurus in the field, John Pound (1995),
identified the three “critical constituencies” of a firm: managers, shareholders, and the board of directors. Ordinary workers, customers, suppliers, and communities aren’t included.

246

GOVERNANCE

One reason the governance issue is interesting is that it’s an implicit
admission that markets do not regulate themselves as perfectly as we’re
told. If the competitive market system worked as well as its adherents say,
then there would be little need for shareholders to worry about how “their”
corporations are run; reward and punishment would be administered by
“the market,” with minimal conscious intervention. The same could be
said about the stock market; if it really did discipline ineffective managers
and reward good ones, then the governance debate would be pretty small
beer. But obviously neither the product nor stock markets work as advertised. That means that capital is admitting that corporations must be subject to some kind of outside oversight. If that’s the case, then the question
becomes oversight by whom, in what form, and in whose interest.
Few economists pay much attention to corporations, or how they’re
owned and run. As Eugene Fama (1991) noted, “many of the corporatecontrol studies appear in finance journals, but the work goes to the heart
of issues in industrial organization, law and economics, and labor economics.” He might have added politics and culture, since these too shape
and are shaped by big business. Corporate governance is too important a
matter to be left to finance theorists.
Economists often analyze financial structures, if they look at them at
all, in a fairly mechanistic fashion. Changes in corporate investment are
treated as almost hydraulically influenced by changes in interest rates or
stock prices.2 They pay much less attention to financial structures as institutions of legal and social control.
Take, for example, the difference between debt and equity. Modigliani
and Miller famously said there was none of any significance. But as Oliver
E. Williamson (1988; 1993) noted, there are great qualitative differences
between them. According to Williamson, the appropriate form of finance
varies with the nature of the underlying corporate assets. Debt is appropriate if the proceeds are used to fund “highly redeployable” assets; if the
borrower gets in trouble, the debt-financed assets could be sold, and the
debts repaid. To finance more specialized investments, which depend on
a specific firm or a narrow market for their value, equity is more appropriate, since equity gives the suppliers of funds the right to supervise managers — and replace them, should things go wrong. In practice, however,
shareholder supervision isn’t as easy as that sounds, as we’ll see in a bit.
The relations between financial and governance structures have become clearer in recent years, as increasing attention has been paid to international differences in corporate ownership and control and their
247

WALL STREET

possible influence on economic performance. Broadly speaking, the U.S.
and Britain share a structure characterized by widely dispersed ownership and loose external controls, while Japan and Germany exhibit much
more concentrated ownership and tighter external control. Of course, such
an extreme characterization does violence to the particulars, and especially so since the systems in all four countries have been changing in
recent years, but it’s still a useful place to start.
The fundamental issues are these: stockholders want high stock prices,
bondholders and other creditors want their interest paid regularly and
their principal eventually returned, and managers want a peaceful life with
high salaries and minimal external intrusion. (In most mainstream theories, what workers want is of no matter; the only theoretical problem is
how to get the most effort out of them for the least pay and with the least
supervisory exertion.) Often these goals collide. High-risk strategies that
might pay off in a big gain in a firm’s stock price may strike creditors as
putting the security of their payment stream at risk. Stockholders may resent the conservative influence of creditors on corporate strategies. Both
sets of outside interests may resent managerial perks and complacency,
while managers might try to mislead outsiders into thinking the corporation is doing better than it really is. When a firm gets into trouble, stockholders are likely to favor indulgence (that is, some degree of debt
forgiveness), while creditors are often happy to see stockholders wiped
out and the firm wholly or partly liquidated to satisfy their claims. Further,
different classes of creditors — there’s usually a hierarchy, with some more
senior than others — may have different interests in a bankruptcy. Managers, however, are often tied to a firm, either through habit, or convenience,
or what economists call firm-specific human capital (which means that
skills honed over the years in a particular corporate environment may be
near-worthless in another), and reluctant to see it liquidated.

transactional analysis
In much received economic theory, the firm is a simple black box, with no
conflicts among managers, workers, creditors, and owners (stockholders).3
The firm simply applies raw materials to its stock of machines and labor,
creates a product that it costlessly and unproblematically sells, and earns
profits for its shareholders. Later, Modigliani and Miller would show that it
didn’t matter where the capital came from, so external finance too became just another input, like labor and raw materials, of no great theoretical or practical interest.
248

GOVERNANCE

In a famous paper that was largely responsible for his winning of the
1991 Nobel Prize in Economics, Ronald H. Coase (1937) challenged this
orthodoxy. Coase posed the question, largely unasked in classical economics, of why firms exist. Coase quoted this aphorism from Sir Arthur
Salter as embodying the classic (and classical) mode of thought — a view
that was to become the routine punditry of the 1990s: “The normal economic system works itself.” That is, supply and demand, production and
consumption, are equilibrated by the self-regulating mechanism of the
price system. Of course, individuals plan for themselves within this selfregulating miracle, but no coordinating institution beyond that is required.
But, Coase countered, Salter’s view does not obtain within the firm at
all. “If a workman moves from department Y to department X, he does not
go because of a change in relative prices, but because he is ordered to do
so.” Firms, in a formulation of D.H. Robertson that Coase quoted approvingly, are “islands of conscious power in this ocean of unconscious cooperation like lumps of butter coagulating in a pail of buttermilk” (as if the
butterlumps thought themselves into existence). Not every aspect of economic activity can be encompassed by the price system. The costs of negotiating contracts for everything would be prohibitive; were a boss to
take bids and write a contract for every letter she needs typed, nothing
would ever get done. In Coasian language, the transaction’s costs would
exceed its return. Further, contracts cannot be written to cover every eventuality; every spill can’t be anticipated, so it pays to have a janitor on hand
to deploy whenever an unexpected disaster presents itself. In such cases,
the price system hardly enters the picture. Or, in Coase’s concise definition, “the distinguishing mark of the firm is the supersession of the price
mechanism.”
But under capitalism, the scope of conscious planning rarely extends
beyond a firm’s boundaries; the price system is the normal governor of
relations among firms and between firms and final consumers. Conventional economics still treats the market as essentially self-regulating: the
system, outside the firm, still works itself. But in reality there are substantial costs of time and money devoted to making the system work. Sellers
must seek buyers, and buyers must weigh the competence and honesty of
sellers. Transactions costs are far from trivial — as much as half U.S. GDP,
according to one estimate cited by Coase (quoted in Williamson and Winter 1993, p. 63).
Though Coase didn’t make the point, the transaction cost argument for
the existence of the firm can be applied to the provision of capital. Con249

WALL STREET

ventional theory assumes that entrepreneurs can raise capital for their
projects effortlessly and costlessly, when in fact they cannot; even the
most seasoned corporation has to pay commissions to the bankers underwriting its paper, and for less established and virginal ventures, capital
can be expensive to raise, if it’s available at all. Established firms economize on such costs by tapping their own in-house sources of capital —
profits. As the figures cited in Chapter 2 on the cost of finance show, these
transaction costs are quite stiff, making internal finance quite attractive.
By introducing the firm as an institution and the transaction as a unit of
analysis, Coase did help bring economics into closer engagement with the
real world — though as he noted in 1970, the paper was “much cited and
little used” (quoted in Williamson and Winter 1993, p. 61). Mainstream
economics remained largely indifferent to the costs of the price system, at
least until the 1970s — ironically, as the supposedly costless “magic of the
marketplace” was about to score great political triumphs.
But in some ways, Coase simply exchanged one black box for another.
While his firm was exposed to the competitive price system on the outside, the firm itself was a conflictless hierarchy that “worked itself.” The
workman told to move from Y to X did as he was told, and there was no
conflict between managers and owners, or creditors and stockholders.
And aside from the rigors of competition, his model of transactions was
also rather pacific. There was no stark conflict between producer and consumer, worker and boss. While his intellectual heirs have introduced some
aspects of these conflicts into their analysis, they tend to use the ideologically neutered language of transactions, contracts, and information, rather
than the more blooded language of conflict and struggle.4
The rediscovery of Coase in the 1970s led to a school of transactions
costs economics, Oliver Williamson prominent among its practitioners,
who use the theory to explain much of social life. Any organization can be
seen as existing to economize on costs. While it’s refreshing to see mainstream economists take some notice of institutions, their assumptions are
still deeply individualistic. Their basic unit of analysis is the transaction;
all the social mechanisms that precede and surround the transaction are
elided. The firm — or nonprofit organization, government, or even family
— is seen as a web of individual contracts, not a social organism with a
life of its own. Politics and power largely disappear in what’s called the
new institutional economics.
Radical institutionalists look to Veblen for a sharper view (Knoedler
1995). Veblen noted that many transactions are undertaken not for effi250

GOVERNANCE

ciency, but for reasons of power — to undermine competitors or secure
monopoly position. He emphasized that businesses wanted to make
money, not run the best industrial system imaginable. The difference in
emphasis is important, because the Coasian view sees the corporation’s
role as maximizing efficiency, not profit, which is another matter entirely.
Advertising, planned obsolescence, predatory pricing, and spurious innovation are partly or wholly socially useless, even malignant, activities, but
they are profit-maximizing. Veblen also argued that an industrial system
run for social efficiency rather than maximum profit might see more internalized and fewer market transactions. Sometimes profit-maximizing will
lead to socially beneficial combination and coordination, but sometimes
it won’t. Janet Knoedler (1995) argued, for example, that GM’s integration
with its suppliers (like Fisher auto body) had less to do with economizing
on costs than with simplifying the annual style change, a marketing rather
than an industrial consideration. But that is getting political, which is something most economists never do.

theorizing corporations
You have to leave the field of economics to find much interesting thinking
about corporations. There’s no better starting point than the taxonomy
proposed by the César Ayala (1989) in his excellent survey of the field.
Ayala, a sociologist, divided the literature on the control of big business
into three schools of thought — Robber Baron, Managerial, and BankSpheres. As he put it, “The Robber Baron school is committed to the idea
that Big Business represents a historical regression which reintroduced
‘feudal’ elements into the economy; the Managerial school is committed
to the idea that managers ‘rule’ the economy; and the Bank-Spheres school
is committed to the idea that banks ‘rule’ the economy.” All three views
have a long pedigree, and remain popular today, embedded in populist
thought of both left and right.
The Robber Baron school holds that the great empire builders of the
late 19th and early 20th century — like Gould, Rockefeller, and Morgan —
appropriated through violence and conspiracy the wealth of the nation
that was once dispersed in the hands of small producers. Rather than viewing concentration as proceeding from the inner essence of capitalism, as
both Marxists and most business historians would, the Robber Baron school
sees it as a perversion of a “natural” state of competition. This naturalization of petty capitalism is a dearly held American myth; it forgets the violence that marked the appropriation of the continent in the first place, and
251

WALL STREET

it also forgets the earlier violence that marked the establishment of capitalism in Europe — the theft of common land, the criminalization of vagrancy, of even poverty itself, that Marx called primitive accumulation.
While the Robber Barons undoubtedly committed many crimes, legal and
moral, during the course of their empire building, and businesses today
commit crimes, literally and figuratively, every day of their existence, there
is little doubt that large firms are far more efficient and formidable competitors than the tiny producers they replaced. It was not crime that made
big business what it is today, nor is it crime that keeps it there.
In this regard, an interesting contrast can be made with British capitalism, which was very late in adopting the modern large corporate form.
Early joint-stock companies were dissolved after they’d done their work
of opening up foreign trade, and the mainstream of business was dominated by small and mid-sized firms of a sort more congenial to the Robber
Baron school. The smaller firms were owned by a family or a small group
of partners, and run in a highly “personal” style, rather than being professionally managed by a well-structured hierarchy. This organizational backwardness gave U.S. and German firms a critical edge as Britain lost ground
to its rivals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Arrighi 1994, p. 282;
Chandler 1990, chapters 7–9).5
These British firms also failed to invest at a sufficiently high level. As
Chandler (1990, p. 285) noted, these failures happened despite the fact
that “London was the largest and most sophisticated capital market in the
world,” a market, ironically, that German and U.S. firms tapped for finance. British money capital preferred to wander overseas in search of
higher returns than were available at home. Deep capital markets are no
substitute for good management, and the presence of the first is no guarantee of the development of the second.

Berle, Means, and managerialism
Typically, the concern with the governance of the modern large corporation, which hinges in the classic formulation on the separation of ownership and control, is traced to Adolph Berle and Gardiner Means’s The
Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932/1967). To Berle and
Means, modern capitalism is characterized by the simultaneous concentration of production in the large corporation and the dispersion of ownership among hordes of shareholders. That dual movement marked a
profound transformation in the nature of property. The function of the
19th century owner–entrepreneur had been divided in two. Formal own252

GOVERNANCE

ership was delivered into the hands of thousands, even millions, of dispersed stockholders, rarely capable of organizing themselves to affect the
operations of the firms whose titles they held. Actual control, however,
fell to managers, who though formally responsible to the stockholders,
were in fact largely independent, self-sustaining, and answerable to no
one in particular as long as things didn’t go badly wrong. In the eyes of
jurisprudence, a firm and its owners were entirely distinct, with the corporation itself acquiring the rather mystical status of a person under law.
This arrangement is a surprisingly recent innovation in economic and
legal life. In the eighteenth century, the corporate charter was essentially
a gift of the state, typically for a very specific purpose, like the right to
trade in the Hudson Bay area, or to run a ferry service.6 This tradition
extended into the 19th century, as the early railroads were laid down.
Frequently it was a grant of monopoly privileges. Charters typically were
specific: the enterprise’s mission was tightly defined, and its capital structure and financial practices were closely supervised.
With the growth in the scale of production, these strictures were loosened. In 1837, Connecticut passed the first modern law of incorporation,
permitting associations “for any lawful business.” Over the next 60 years,
most other states fell into line. Step by step with the development of the
modern corporation — or maybe just a step or two behind — came the
growth of managerial autonomy. For example, in the early 19th century,
shareholders weren’t allowed to delegate their vote by proxy to management; but by the time of Berle and Means, the proxy had become “one of
the principal instruments not by which a stockholder exercises power over
the management of the enterprise but by which his power is separated
from him” (p. 129). Shareholders typically have had neither the time nor
the machinery necessary for scrutinizing management and attending annual meetings, so in normal times they delegate the responsibility of voting their shares to the managers who are formally their hired agents.
In his preface to the 1967 revised edition, Berle described the new system as one of “collective capitalism,” an affair that yokes together thousands of corporations, and millions of employees, owners, and customers
— too many people to be considered private enterprise in the classic sense;
and since the state was now so deeply involved in economic affairs, no
redefinition of “private” could ever be broad enough to apply. Research
was no longer carried out by lone inventors, but in teams, and no longer
within a single enterprise, but in cooperation with university and government researchers — often with subsidies from public and nonprofit sources.
253

WALL STREET

(Despite the individualist ideology of the high-tech world, basic research
as well as product development still is highly social.) To the 1967 Berle,
these changes had moved us “toward a new phase fundamentally more
alien to the tradition of profit even than that forecast” in the first edition of
their book, published 35 years earlier.
Reading the updated Berle 27 years later, even more than the 1932 original, it’s hard to imagine that anyone could have thought that modern corporate society moves by anything significantly different from the
maximization of profit. But the belief that the advent of the large corporation had changed capitalism into a more humane, progressive force was a
core belief of American liberalism from the New Deal through the end of
the 1960s. Profit maximization, the motor of 19th century entrepreneurial
capitalism, had been replaced by growth, and competition by long-term
corporate planning and administered prices. In one moving cri de rentier
(pp. 115–116), Berle and Means denounced the potential for managerial
abuse of the poor owner: “out of professional pride,” managers may “maintain labor standards above those required by competitive conditions,” or
“improve quality above the point” that is likely to be maximally profitable
to shareholders! This holds the potential for “a new form of absolutism,
relegating ‘owners’ to the position of those who supply the means whereby
the new princes may exercise their power.” Reversing the usual populist
casting, it’s not the owner of capital who is the parasite in this model, but
the managers who run production.
As Berle and Means put it, historically speaking, shareholders have “surrendered a set of definite rights for a set of indefinite expectations” (p.
244). For example, shareholders have no right to sell corporate property
on their own; they delegate such powers to their agents, managers. That
alone makes shareholding a different kind of ownership from what the
common sense of the word describes. But shareholders have an out: they
can sell their shares. As Berle and Means said, stock markets are a means
for transforming these expectations into cash, which is why the market is
“a focal point in the corporate system of today” (p. 248). If there were no
market to let them out of a position quickly and cheaply, absentee owners
would think twice about assuming their strange role.
Berle and Means spoke of investors as supplying capital to corporations, and argued that the markets’ provision of liquidity allows them to
get this money back on a moment’s notice at no expense to the corporation. But stock investors rarely supply funds to the corporations they own;
with rare exceptions, they’re simply buying shares issued long ago from
254

GOVERNANCE

others who bought them in the same manner. So the social division of
labor that Berle and Means describe — between the providers of capital
who are the real risktakers and the managers who are largely insulated
from risk — is too flattering to the rentier.
Their characterization of stockholders as entirely passive is quaint. While
Berle and Means did acknowledge a disciplinary role for stock prices in
general — firms that want to raise equity capital have to cultivate the markets’ favor — they allowed for no direct assertion of shareholder influence on management. Quite the contrary; they described the relation
between stockholders and the modern firm as fundamentally casual.
For property to be easily passed from hand to hand, the individual relation
of the owner to it must necessarily play little part. It cannot be dependent
for its continued value upon his activity. Consequently, to translate property into liquid form the first requisite is that it demand as little as possible
of its owner.... [I]f property is to become a liquid [sic] it must not only be
separated from responsibility but it must become impersonal — like Iago’s
purse: “ ’twas mine, ‘tis his, and hath been slave to thousands” (p. 250).

Impersonal, alienated property, easily parceled out and passed around:
what an alluring model of society.
The Modern Corporation and Private Property offered a rethink of the
notion of profit (p. 300). By official definitions, profit is the reward for
risk-taking and a spur to efficiency. What then will motivate modern managers? Although they control the pace of innovations in production, any
windfall profits they might generate will mostly be passed on to stockholders. If managers do innovate, they aren’t properly rewarded; and if
they know they won’t be properly rewarded, they may shirk at innovation. Bureaucracy, dispersed ownership, and complex and contradictory
sets of incentives had replaced the clarity of the owner-manager of yore.
Berle and Means (p. 245) rather excessively called this an “approach toward communist modalities.”
Ironically, this line of thinking has gone out of fashion with the capitalist triumphalism of recent years, whose preferred mode has been the celebration of the entrepreneur. Of course, right-wing ideologues and
publicists have celebrated smaller firms and demeaned dinosaurs like IBM,
but the grip of giant firms on the U.S. economy — and increasingly on the
global economy — has hardly been loosened.
These ideas didn’t originate with Berle and Means. A century and a half
earlier, Adam Smith (1976, Book 2, pp. 264–265) had this to say about the
255

WALL STREET

joint-stock company (a quote that’s a staple of the corporate governance
literature, and this chapter will be no exception):
The directors of such companies, being the managers rather of other people’s
money than of their own, it cannot be well expected that they should watch
over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private
copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich
man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their
master’s honor, and very easily give themselves a dispensation for having
it. Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less,
in the management of the affairs of such a company.

Smith made this sound like the doom of capitalism, something the corporate form has obviously not brought about.
Berle and Means themselves cited Walther Rathenau’s observations,
drawn from German experience, that ownership had been “depersonalized,” and the enterprise itself had been “objectified” into “an independent life, as if it belonged to no one…. [This] leads to a point where the
enterprise becomes transformed into an institution which resembles the
state in character” (p. 309). This prefigured Berle and Means; Smith’s observation reads more like an early version of modern rentier thought.
Writing in 1896, Herbert Spencer (1972) noted that the development of
the credit system had allowed production to break beyond the limits of
individual owners or small partnerships, a development that also “made
available for industrial purposes, numberless savings which otherwise
would have been idle…. [S]tagnant capital has almost disappeared.” Stagnant capital is no capital at all; Spencer meant that money hoards that
might have festered in isolation can, by virtue of the modern system, be
transformed into capital. But, as he’d written 30 years earlier in “Railway
Morals and Railway Policy,” the joint-stock structure is rich with opportunities for mischief. The system reproduces all the faults of political democracy, Spencer argued; just as there are tremendous gaps between voters
and their representatives, shareholders have little effective control over a
firm’s directors and managers, and directors and managers resent any expression of supervisory interest. “Like their prototype, joint-stock companies have their expensive election contests, managed by election
committees, employing election agents; they have their canvassing with
its sundry illegitimate accompaniments; they have their occasional manufacture of fraudulent votes.” While modern law has made outright fraud
extremely rare, in both the political and corporate arenas, Spencer’s de256

GOVERNANCE

scription remains an accurate characterization of the corporate proxy contest. The difficulty of running an electoral challenge to corporate management gives the “small organized party” a great advantage over “the large
unorganized one.” Shareholders are “diffused throughout the whole kingdom, in towns and country houses; knowing nothing of each other, and
too remote to coöperate were they acquainted.” They know nothing about
business, and are, in most cases, “incompetent to judge of the questions
that come before them.” Spencer painted this unflattering picture of the
typical railway’s ultimate owners:
[E]xecutors who do not like to take steps involving much responsibility;
trustees fearful of interfering with the property under their care, lest possible loss should entail a lawsuit; widows who have never in their lives
acted for themselves in any affair of moment; maiden ladies, alike nervous
and innocent of all business knowledge; clergymen whose daily discipline
has been little calculated to make them acute men of the world; retired
tradesmen whose retail transactions have given them small ability for grasping large considerations; servants possessed of accumulated savings and
cramped notions; with sundry others of like helpless character — all of them
rendered more or less conservative by ignorance or timidity, and proportionately inclined to support those in authority. To these should be added
the class of temporary shareholders, who, having bought stock on speculation, and knowing that a revolution in the Company is likely to depress
prices for a time, have an interest in supporting the board irrespective of
the goodness of its policy.

Don’t managers and shareholders share an interest in maximizing profits?
No, Spencer said; managers may have no long-term interest in the firm,
but may bend its affairs to maximize their personal profits rather than the
firm’s. Spencer joins Smith as a precursor of modern rentier thought.
Berle and Means made the same point about managerial opportunism
in their conclusion: “the men in control of a corporation can operate it in
their own interests, and can divert a portion of the asset fund or income
stream to their own uses,” and the shareholders are sociologically and
legally powerless to stop this. Had they stopped here, Berle and Means
would have fit nicely into the proto-rentier crowd. But, according to them,
instead of trying to strengthen the rights of “passive shareholders,” “the
community” could choose to relax classic notions of property rights. Outright plunder should be prevented, but the community must also assert its
rights, and the corporation must be governed in “the larger interests of
257

WALL STREET

society. Should the corporate leaders, for example, set forth a program
comprising fair wages, security to employees, reasonable service to their
public, and stabilization of business,” the shareholders should accept the
hit to profits guaranteed by this high-minded program. Corporate control,
they concluded, “should develop into a purely neutral technocracy, balancing a variety of claims by various groups in the community and assigning to each a portion of the income stream on the basis of public policy
rather than private cupidity” (pp. 312–313). Economic government would
come to resemble classic American interest-group politics.7
Mainstream economics acknowledged the transformations outlined by
Berle and Means, but claimed that they didn’t matter much. Competitive
product markets and the threat of takeover assured the basic classical notions of the firm (insofar as the firm was theorized at all) still applied to
large, manager-dominated firms as well as small entrepreneurial units. The
firm as black box essentially survived both Coase and Berle and Means.
Outside mainstream economics, however, managerialism held great
sway, even on much of the left. As Baran and Sweezy (1966, pp. 15–16)
said in Monopoly Capital, in the modern giant corporation, “control rests
in the hands of management...a self-perpetuating group” with
“[r]esponsibility to the body of stockholders...a dead letter.” They dismissed
fashionable propaganda of the 1950s and 1960s — like Berle’s, among
others — about how the “soulful corporation” had come to balance social
responsibility with profit making, arguing to the contrary that modern firms
are if anything better positioned to maximize profits than the smaller ones
of yore, because of longer planning horizons. In their model, investment
funds are almost entirely internally generated (which they still are), and
therefore firms are largely independent of the financial sector (which they
still aren’t). While Baran and Sweezy rightly noted the incredible expense
of intermediation — the army of high-paid brokers, agents, and bankers
— its role was largely unexamined; instead, finance was reduced to an
“absorber of surplus,” and dismissed in less than three pages (Baran and
Sweezy 1966, pp. 139–141).
For liberals of the 1960s, the scripture was Galbraith’s (1967/1978) New
Industrial State. To Galbraith, the stockholders were vestigial, a “purely
pecuniary association” divorced from management, too numerous and
dispersed to have any influence (Galbraith 1967/1978, pp. 71–79, 138).
When displeased with “their” corporation, they would sell the stock rather
than pick a fight with management. Stockholder rebellion among large
corporations was “so rare that it can be ignored,” because trouble-free
258

GOVERNANCE

profitability was the norm. Of course, management told Congressional
committees that the board and the stockholders were in control, and conducted yearly meetings to flatter the nominal owners, but Galbraith’s corporation was run by the technostructure.
Unlike Baran and Sweezy, Galbraith dismissed profit maximization as
the goal of the giant firm in favor of the growth in sales and prestige. To
thrive, it needed not maximum profits, but “a secure minimum of earnings” that would keep it from having to tap troublesome capital markets
or cope with demanding outside stockholders (pp. 151–152). Secure mediocrity was the ideal. The technostructure had little to gain from high
profits, which would only be passed along to shareholders, and might
even entail higher risk — risk that could disturb managerial autonomy.
His technocrats were modestly paid, and managerial compensation was
divorced from the stock price. “[T]he case for maximization of personal
return by top management is not strong” (p. 108). Growth in revenue,
however, was a sure route to growing power, prestige, and employment:
“Expansion of output means expansion of the technostructure itself” (p.
157). The totem of sales growth was magnified on the national level in the
sanctification of rapid GDP growth as the end of all economic activity.
But, warned Galbraith, any lapse in growth could be catastrophic. His
reasoning is illuminating in light of recent middle-management layoffs.
“Costs can no longer be reduced simply by laying off blue-collar workers.” The technostructure had become a major cost-center, in modern jargon, and could not be reduced piecemeal, but would have to be lopped
off in vast swathes. Worse, the technostructure would have to make the
decision to attack itself — to fire one’s fellow club members. Such actions
“would not have the agreeable impersonality which is associated with firing someone at a greater distance or of a different social class” (p. 158).
Like Berle, but unlike Baran and Sweezy, Galbraith argued that the large
corporation had become subservient to society and the state. Government
stabilized the economy, provided a skilled workforce, and set the strategic tone for the national economy. Planning and administration, a joint
venture by large firms and the state, had replaced market relations. Stockholders had become “passive and functionless, remarkable only in his
capacity to share, without effort or even without appreciable risk, the gains
from the growth by which the technostructure measures its success” (p.
356). The (Keynes-echoing) “euthanasia of stockholder power,” along with
the supersession of the market mechanism by the state and the technostructure, had become “accepted facts of life” (p. 357). Galbraith lodged
259

WALL STREET

aesthetic objections to this new regime — it made ugly cities and vulgar
ads — but its political and economic triumph seemed secure.
Edward Herman’s 1981 study, financed by the Twentieth Century Fund,
was a swan song of managerialism. Based on 1970s data, Herman found
U.S. firms to be overwhelmingly under managerial control, with a steady
decline in control by families, financial interests, and outside corporations
since the 1920s. Citing work by Richard Rumelt, Herman nonetheless rejected Galbraith’s claims about the diminished role of profit maximization, arguing that the modern corporation’s decentralized “profit centers,”
individual units responsible for profit and loss to top management, were a
form of direct scrutiny that could be even more intense than the less immediate pressures of product markets. Senior managers of U.S. corporations often run them as a sort of hothouse capital market, with divisions
competing aggressively for the allocation of capital from headquarters.
Managerialism, liberal and Marxist, shared a belief that competition was
a thing of the past. Stable oligopolies and managerial rationality had replaced the anarchy of 19th century laissez-faire. In some sense, this was
an accurate description of the world, particularly the United States, in the
1950s and 1960s. It ceased to be true by the 1970s. The conglomeratization
movement of the late 1960s thrust Wall Street into the remaking of corporate America; neither vestigial nor passive, financial operators played board
games with whole companies. The recession of 1973–75, then the worst
since the 1930s, shattered confidence and was the first view of a new
nastiness in the economic tone that would characterize the next 20 years.
U.S. firms would suffer the bite of competition from Japan and Europe,
smashing the Galbraithian idyll. The deep bear market of 1973–74, the
first act of several years of sluggish-to-awful stock markets, led to massive
shareholder disappointment and a fresh wave of takeover activity, the
first since the 1960s. Managerialism was under siege.
Aux armes, rentiers!
Early U.S. manifestations of bank or financial control theories were the
heartland populism of the middle and late 19th century, which was directed against the railroads and the financiers behind them. This populist
tradition was picked up by the muckrakers of the turn of the century, who
blasted Standard Oil, Morgan, and the other “spheres of influence” (Ayala’s
Bank-Spheres school). In 1913, the famed Pujo Committee of the U.S.
House of Representatives uncovered a system of interlocking directorates
and other forms of influence centered around six major banks: J.P. Mor260

GOVERNANCE

gan & Co.; First National Bank of New York; the National City Bank of
New York; Lee, Higginson & Co.; Kidder Peabody; and Kuhn, Loeb. The
bankers’ control over credit to the giant enterprises in their orbit gave
them control over the commanding heights of the U.S. economy, creating
significant barriers to entry for those outside the circle. This is the purest
form of banker control theory. Later analysts, including Paul Sweezy in
the 1930s, made similar influence maps, though not always with the same
names and positions. Sweezy’s model was not bank-centered, but he did
include a bank in each one of his eight major groups. Only a few years
later, however, Sweezy decided that financial power had declined during
the Depression (Ayala 1989), and by the 1960s, finance largely disappeared
from Monopoly Capital. It reappeared, though, in the pages of Sweezy’s
Monthly Review starting in the 1970s. This oscillating theoretical role for
finance is a reflection of historical trends, rather than confusion or inconsistency; it’s refreshing to watch a theorist change with the times rather
than catechistically stick to a single model and bend the facts to fit.
Interest in financial control, or at least influence, began to grow across
the ideological spectrum. In the mainstream, Baum and Stiles (1965), spied
a growing potential for financial power that was as yet unexercised. After
the 1968 publication of a report by the House Banking Committee, detailing the ownership of large blocks of stock by the trust departments of the
major New York City banks, theories of financial control enjoyed a renaissance on the left, notably the long, book-length series in Socialist Revolution by Robert Fitch and Mary Oppenheimer (1970) and the later book by
David Kotz (1978) — a book that owes a great deal to Fitch and
Oppenheimer. Most Marxists rejected the Fitch/Oppenheimer thesis —
that the New York banks were exerting increasing control over industrial
America, and that managerialism was dead — with great vehemence.
In a response to Fitch and Oppenheimer, Paul Sweezy (1972) answered
the question of their title, “who rules the corporations?” with a simple
declaration: “monopoly capital rules the corporations, including not only
industrials and utilities but also banks and other profit making institutions.”
Following Marx’s formula that the capitalist is the personification of capital, Sweezy argued that monopoly capital was personified by monopoly
capitalists, that is, the inhabitants of “the executive suites and boardrooms
of America’s giant corporations.” According to Sweezy, there was no conflict between financial and industrial interests; faithful to Lenin and
Hilferding, he argued instead that monopoly capital was the union of finance and industry into a single entity. The giant corporation, with its
261

WALL STREET

dozens of subsidiaries and divisions, was more a financial being, not unlike a stock portfolio, than the simple productive unit run directly by an
old-style industrialist. If finance were separate from and dominant over
industry, Sweezy asked, why did the lordly financiers allow General Motors to set up a subsidiary to finance vehicle purchases (the General Motors Acceptance Corp., or GMAC)?
There’s no question that the large Fortune 500-class industrial corporation is run on financial principles, that its business units are often deeply
involved in finance — General Electric has a very active financial arm, GE
Capital; the other big auto companies have large units like GMAC; and all
the familiar rest. But there’s also no question that in recent years purely
financial interests have increasingly asserted their influence over these
hybridized giant corporations.
Kotz outlined several stages in the evolution of finance’s relationship
with nonfinancial corporations. The first, between the Civil War and World
War I was characterized by first the promotion of railroads and then their
subsequent reorganization, with the help of European capital, and then
the promotion of the big industrial trusts — all under the guiding hand of
bankers. The next period, which ran through the 1929 crash, was marked
by a trend towards institutionalization and away from strong individual
bankers, and the international transformation of the U.S. from borrower
to lender. During the New Deal, the bankers were on the run, blamed for
the slump and finding themselves under closer scrutiny and tighter regulation. No one needed the investment bankers either; large corporations
financed themselves, either through profits or direct deals with institutions, and the federal Reconstruction Finance Corp. usurped “a great part
of the functions of what in an economic sense is investment banking,” in
the words of a Wall Street partner (quoted in Carosso 1970, p. 395). After
World War II, however, Kotz argued, there was a resurgence of banker
power, led by insurance companies, mutual funds, and, most important,
the trust departments of commercial banks.
Unfortunately, Kotz turned to the old model of groups, though he
couldn’t decide whether the groups were dominated by their banks, with
the industrial members subordinate, or if they represented a fusion of common interests. Kotz’s classification scheme was this: a Chase group, consisting of two commercial banks, Chase Manhattan and Chemical, and
two insurance companies, Metropolitan Life and the Equitable; a Morgan
group, consisting of two commercial banks, Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust, the Prudential insurance company, and two investment banks,
262

GOVERNANCE

Morgan, Stanley and Smith, Barney; a Mellon group, consisting of
Pittsburgh’s Mellon Bank and the investment bank First Boston; and a
Lehman–Goldman, Sachs Group, consisting of those two old-line (predominantly Jewish, in contrast to the WASPy pedigree of the other groups)
investment banks (Kotz 1978, p. 85). While the case for such alliances has
been difficult to make since the New Deal reforms of the 1930s, the concept looks hopelessly out of date in the 1990s. Long-term relationship
banking broke apart beginning in the late 1970s; customers and bankers
now shop around for the best deal rather than respecting long-term business ties; portfolio management boutiques have eclipsed bank trust departments in money management; and ownership changes have
transformed the supposed interest-group landscape. Prudential bought
Bache in the early 1980s to have its own in-house investment bank and
distribution network for offloading some of its own financial holdings;
Smith Barney is now a subsidiary of the Travelers insurance company;
First Boston is owned by a Swiss bank; and Lehman has been bought and
sold several times.
Kotz was also unable to argue persuasively that financial control made
much difference. He claimed that corporations under financial control were
likely to maximize profits, with perhaps a bit more caution than they might
otherwise — more like old-line capitalist firms than the “soulful” manager-run corporations of high liberal theory (Kotz 1978, pp. 143–144). He
further argued that financial control meant a greater concentration of economic and political power than textbook myths about competitive markets and dispersed power. While this is undeniably true, large manager-run
corporations also give the lie to textbook myths — it’s hard to reconcile
the real GM with the textbook image of the passive, price-taking corporation adapting to market conditions — and Kotz’s claims about the exercise of monopoly power by banks were largely speculative and unproved.
Kotz and Fitch and Oppenheimer were virtually alone in the 1970s in
arguing for a major financial role in the governance of big business.
Managerialism had largely won the theoretical argument and it seemed
empirically well-grounded, too.

the financial upsurge
Things in the mid-1990s, however, are another story entirely. Today’s corporate world bears little resemblance to that described by Galbraith, Baran
and Sweezy, and Herman: shareholders are far less passive, boards less
rubber-stampish, and managements less autonomous than at any time since
263

WALL STREET

Berle and Means. Since the early 1980s, influence from the financial sphere
has been greater than at any time since the 1920s.
It’s not so much that the managerialists were wrong. Their descriptions
and analysis were right for their time, but the corporate world has changed
enormously over the past 20 years. There was little conflict between managers and stockholders during the Golden Age, and it even seemed possible that wages could increase steadily without eating into profits. Large
firms could behave as quasi-monopolies, raising prices when costs rose,
controlling the pace of technical change, and blocking entry of competitors. Now that Golden Age is gone. Growth is suppressed through tight
monetary and fiscal policy, technical change is rapid, companies as grand
as IBM and GM can stumble, wages have been forced down to expand
profits, and competition is encouraged worldwide by deregulation and
market-opening policies. The owners — stockholders, Wall Street, whatever you want to call them — have encouraged these changes in the interests of controlling inflation and boosting the prices of financial assets.
Their control isn’t preeminent; managers have resisted stockholder interference, though workers have lost nearly every battle. Managerialism and
the vestigial role of the stockholder were historically contingent features
of the Golden Age, not the markers of a new phase of capitalism.
“Financial control” is an admittedly imprecise term, encompassing a
whole spectrum of influences. Its classic U.S. usage refers to the takeover
of industrial firms by banker–operators like J.P. Morgan, buying up an
important share of its securities and taking seats on the board. When a
firm was “Morganized,” there was no question about who controlled it,
whatever the formal financial and managerial structures. While that kind
of direct bankerly control was banned by the financial reforms of the 1930s,
there are some industrial firms that were taken over during the 1980s,
brought under the control, if not ownership, of leveraged buyout boutiques like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Forstman, Little — though for the
most part this treatment was reserved for firms below Fortune 500 size. In
many, perhaps most, cases, these were not intended as permanent arrangements; the idea was to take the company public again at a later date
at a great profit to the buyout artisans — either because they managed to
achieve new efficiencies thanks to their managerial genius and the disciplinary effects of debt, or because an interminable bull market would simply accommodate them profitably through the mere passage of time.
Influence need not be so direct as outright ownership. The classic textbook explanation of the power of finance is that investors and bankers
264

GOVERNANCE

scrutinize firms when they seek outside money, either debt or equity. Certainly this is the case, but influence need not be even this direct. Managers
may simply take a cue from the price of their firm’s stock, or listen to the
advice of analysts and investors about what course they could take to
boost it. Also, most large corporations have representatives of banks and
insurance companies sitting on their boards, but of course their degree of
influence is both debatable and variable.
Such financial boardmembers may only exert their influence at critical
moments. As Kevin Delaney (1992, pp. 69–71) pointed out, John Schroeder,
a retired vice-chair of J.P. Morgan who served on the Johns–Manville board,
was instrumental in pushing the firm to file for bankruptcy when faced by
mounting legal claims for exposing its workers and customers to asbestos. (Morgan had served as Manville’s lead bank for over 50 years.) Bankruptcy protected the assets of the company against claims of the litigants,
allowing the creditors not only to be repaid in full, but also to lend Manville
fresh money at high interest rates. Stockholders were nearly wiped out,
and the asbestos victims’ awards were strictly capped. The moral — the
corporate governance moral, that is, leaving aside the stingy treatment of
the injured — is that the financier on the board may be quiet when things
are going well, but in a crisis, he or she may be a crucial player.
The Johns–Manville example may be a model of the broader upsurge
of financial influence; financiers may have been satisfied with corporate
performance during the Golden Age, but more recent decades have been
the economy-wide equivalent of an asbestos crisis. This might be a good
time to take a look at recent theories of corporate governance.

Jensenism
Starting in the mid-1970s, Michael Jensen, Chicago-school fellow traveller
now at Harvard, began developing a finance-based theory of corporate
governance that would become influential in the 1980s. Though it took
some time to evolve to full ripeness, Jensen’s argument is, in a phrase, that
stockholders can’t trust the managers they’ve hired to run their corporations, and a radical realignment is in order.
In 1976, Jensen and his collaborator William Meckling tried to build a
formal model relating financial structure and managerial performance. As
with most formal models, their indifference curves and δB(X*)’s were built
on a series of simplifying assumptions. Listing those of Jensen and Meckling
should remind lay readers just how strange these exercises can get (numbers omitted):
265

WALL STREET

All taxes are zero.
No trade credit is available.
All outside equity shares are non-voting.
No complex financial claims such as convertible bonds or preferred stock
or warrants can be issued.
No outside owner ever gains utility from ownership in a firm in any way
other than through its effect on his wealth or cash flows.
All dynamic aspects of the multiperiod nature of the problem are ignored
by assuming there is only one production–financing decision to be made
by the entrepreneur.
The entrepreneur–manager’s money wages are held constant throughout
the analysis.
There exists a single manager (the peak coordinator) with ownership interest in the firm.

Every one of these assumptions violates reality. Among the more glaring
violations: taxes exist prominently; net trade credit to nonfinancial corporations was over $340 billion at the end of 1995; it’s a rare corporation that
issues nonvoting shares; time is continuous and endlessly complicating,
since today’s bad decision can haunt managers for years; there are many
layers of management beneath the “peak coordinator.”
Let’s set these reservations aside, however, and explore Jensen’s world.
No matter what you think of his answers, Jensen and his collaborators —
Meckling, here — have asked some important questions about a social
institution that is commonly accepted as part of the landscape, the large
joint-stock corporation: “How does it happen that millions of individuals
are willing to turn over a significant fraction of their wealth to organizations run by managers who have so little interest in their welfare? What is
even more remarkable, why are they willing to make these commitments
purely as residual claimants, i.e., on the anticipation that managers will
operate the firm so that there will be earnings which accrue to the stockholders?” In plainer English, why, in a world that runs on self-interest, do
individual and institutional shareholders entrust the management of the
corporations that they legally own to strangers? And why do they arrange
it so that they, as stockholders, are the last in line to be paid, after suppliers, creditors, and employees?
It’s a marriage of convenience, of course, and, the new critique aside,
it’s been a successful one. For one, it makes sense for individual entrepreneurs who strike it rich to take their companies public, accumulate finan266

GOVERNANCE

cial capital, and put their eggs into baskets other than their own.8 And just
because investors have money doesn’t mean they have technical and organizational skills; in an economy characterized by the relentless subdivision of labor, it’s no surprise they hire help to run the properties. But over
time the rentier function has become institutionalized and the help has
evolved into the professional managers of the modern transnational corporation. These two groups can be expected to have areas of disagreement. In the trade, this is known as principal–agent conflict.
Jensen and Meckling spent a lot of time laying out the agency costs of
the separation of ownership and control for large U.S. corporations. Managers will typically try to pamper themselves before passing along dividends to the legal owners; the Jensen–Meckling model actually formalizes
this as “X = {x1, x2,…,xn} = a vector of quantities of all factors and activities
within the firm from which the manager derives non-pecuniary benefits,
such as office space, air conditioning, thickness of the carpets, friendliness of employee relations, etc.” — perks. Calling them perks would look
unscientific; disguising them as a vector lends the prestige of mathematics
to those easily seduced by subscripts. To minimize perk-grabbing, creditors and stockholders require explicit, frequent financial reporting and
outside audits, and also tinker endlessly with the ways of paying senior
managers so as to provide the right mix of punishment and reward. On
the other hand, executives are suspicious that outside stockholders and
creditors are always trying to second-guess them, or cramp their managerial style. Managers and claimants inevitably keep a wary eye on each
other; the expense of doing so is known as agency costs.
Managers, Jensen and Meckling argued, would manage in the interest
of the outside claimants if they held bigger stakes in the companies. (It’s
assumed that stockholders’ interests are paramount.) Executives’ debt and
stock holdings should be evenly balanced, to assure they never try to reward or screw one class of holders at the expense of the other (like risky
ventures that might offer a big stock payoff, but could lead to default on
the bonds, or cautious investments that guarantee steady interest payments
but could bore stockholders). Jensen’s ultimate sympathies are with risk;
in what would later become an obsession, he and Meckling argued that
stock options should be an important part of a top manager’s pay, “which
in effect give him [sic] a claim on the upper tail of the outcome distribution” — a big personal payoff if the stock booms. Unspoken is the assumption that stock prices reliably price managerial decisions; Jensenite
theories of governance rest on efficient market theory. If the market sets
267

WALL STREET

prices inefficiently, then companies will sometimes wrongly get taken over
and managers will sometimes be unfairly overpaid (as opposed, I guess,
to normal times when they’re fairly overpaid).
But Jensen hadn’t yet truly warmed to his subject. Despite all the words
and formulas devoted to the costs of agency, his collaboration with
Meckling ended with this defense of the status quo: “The growth in the
use of the corporate form as well as the growth in market value of established corporations suggests that at least, up to the present, creditors and
investors have by and large not been disappointed with the results, despite the agency costs inherent in the corporate form.”
Earlier in the paper, the authors had dismissed what would later be
called leveraged buyouts, a transaction whose primary academic celebrant
was the later Jensen. It would be possible, Jensen and Meckling argued, to
eliminate agency costs if shareholders sold firms to managers, who financed
their purchase of 100% of the firm’s stock with debt and personal wealth.
Since this rarely happens, they reasoned, there must be some compelling
reasons why. Among those reasons, they concluded, were a rational wariness on the part of creditors, who would worry that managers would take
big gambles, hoping for big payoffs that, should they not arrive, would
greatly increase the risk of default, even bankruptcy. Preventing those
risks would greatly increase the creditors’ agency costs, since they’d have
to keep managers under constant scrutiny to make sure they weren’t playing roulette with the creditors’ money.
Jensen changed his mind in the 1980s, becoming the scourge of the
public corporation and the typical CEO. A paper written just seven years
later with Richard Ruback (Jensen and Ruback 1983) celebrated the virtues of the market for corporate control as a market in which “alternative
managerial teams compete for the rights to manage corporate resources.”
This marked a shift, said Jensen and Ruback, from the classic view in which
stockholders hired and fired management:
[T]he managerial competition model instead views competing management
teams as the primary activist entities, with stockholders (including institutions) playing a relatively passive…judicial role…. [S]tockholders in this
system have relatively little use for detailed knowledge about the firm or
the plans of competing management teams beyond that normally used for
the market’s price setting function. Stockholders have no loyalty to incumbent managers; they simply choose the highest dollar value offer from those
presented to them in a well-functioning market for corporate control.

In this world, everything is constantly up for auction. It assumes that
the “market” — which it’s conceded is populated by players with no special expertise in the businesses they have at their mercy — can value each
management slate’s cash-generating potential presciently, and that this
constant turmoil has no harmful effect on production. Why everyone
should turn somersaults to satisfy passive, almost vestigial, stockholders
is one of the great unexplored mysteries of Jensenism; the stock market is
always axiomatically the ultimate arbiter of social good.
Jensen (1986a) turned up the heat just three years later, arguing then
that it wasn’t enough to change managers; managers had to be put under
a new disciplinary structure. Despite the pressures of competitive product
markets, the bosses of big, public corporations waste money on unproductive (that is, unprofitable) expenditures like perks, investment, and
R&D — money that should instead be piped to shareholders. “Free cash
flow” was the problem, and Jensen’s definition is worth quoting:
Free cash flow is cash flow in excess of that required to fund all projects
that have positive net present values when discounted at the relevant cost
of capital. Conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers over
payout policies are especially severe when the organization generates substantial cash flow. The problem is how to motivate managers to disgorge
the cash rather than investing it at below the cost of capital or wasting it on
organzation [sic] inefficiencies.

Jensen’s definition sounds more precise than it really is. Cash flow and
cost of capital are relatively easy to figure — though different analysts will
come up with different measures for each.9 Judging future projects is the
really tricky bit; it assumes firms can know how much money a project
can earn. Of course they never can. In practice, one can do little but extrapolate from the past, but that’s not really the same thing.
Still, quibbles aside, Jensen was really onto something. Many big firms
have more money than they know what to do with — or, more strictly
speaking, have more money than they can invest in their basic businesses
at a reasonable profit — a more colloquial definition of free cash flow.10
Margaret Blair and Martha Schary (1993a and 1993b) estimated free cash
flow for 18 and then 71 industrial sectors. They used historical data on
profitability, which isn’t pure Jensen, but that’s about all you can do, since
one can’t divine the future. They found a sharp squeeze on firms, with
profitability roughly flat but with a sharp increase in the cost of capital
from the 1970s into the 1980s, the result mainly of sustained high interest
269

WALL STREET

rates. As the cost of capital rose — the rate of return required by investors
under orthodox finance theory — firms could justify only the highestprofit (and one might assume quickest payback, though Blair and Schary
don’t say this) projects. As they put it, “The expected profitability of future
investments fell just as the profitability required by the capital markets
climbed to unprecedented highs…. [F]rom 1982 through 1989 the U.S.
corporate sector was caught up in an epidemic of free cash flow” (Blair
and Schary 1993a, p. 128). In the mid-1990s, it looks like they are once
again, but they’re doing different things with the money now from what
they did in the 1980s.
Jensen’s (1986a) answer was to load up these firms with debt — a nice
irony, since a broad and sustained demand for fresh debt will push interest rates higher than they would otherwise be, thereby making even more
cash flow “free.” Jensen offered a nice rationale for Wall Street’s liberation
of ever more cash flow. Unlike stock, which allows managers to pay what
they like to shareholders, high debt bills “bond” managers to pay out a
steady stream of cash, rather than “wasting resources on low-return
projects.” Managers should also receive a large share of their compensation in the form of stock, to make them think and act like shareholders.
As the decade wore on, Jensen celebrated the advent of a new form —
the LBO (leveraged buyout) association (Jensen 1989a). The large public
company was OK, Jensen said, in growing sectors like computers, biotech,
and finance. But older industries —tires, steel, chemicals, brewing, broadcasting, tobacco, pulp and paper products now, and aerospace, cars, banking, electric utilities, machinery in the future — need to be transformed
through leverage and ownership. In an LBO, a group of investors, often
along with a firm’s senior management, take a company private by going
deep into debt. The stock typically doesn’t trade on a public exchange —
though occasionally a small “stub” of shares is left over and continues to
trade openly — but is held tightly by the circle of investors.11 The discipline of debt and the potential vast rewards from holding the stock would
inspire managers to heroic feats of accumulation.
This is a marked turnabout from the Jensen of 1976, who had said (with
Meckling) that the public corporation seemed to be here to stay, arguing
even that LBOs were perverse and risky. Asked by email to explain this
radical turn in his thinking, Jensen replied: “What happened was that the
data began to indicate quite clearly that the system was not working OK.
That the inefficiencies were in fact just as we had seen them in theory, but
the markets took a while to adjust. That adjustment is still taking place.”
270

GOVERNANCE

Jensen especially celebrated LBOs engineered by boutiques like
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Clayton & Dubalier; “entrepreneurs”
like Carl Icahn, Ronald Perelman, Irwin Jacobs, and Warren Buffett; merchant banking arms of Morgan Stanley and Lazard Frères; and families
like the Pritzkers and Bronfmans. These fine people — the forgotten stars
of the largely forgotten 1980s — should be trusted to run corporate America
like a stock portfolio, from their thinly staffed (20 to 60 people) home
offices, transforming the industrial cities of yesteryear into ghost towns.
With all its vast increases in data, talent, and technology, Wall Street can
allocate capital among competing businesses and monitor and discipline
management more effectively than the CEO and headquarters staff of the
typical diversified company. KKR’s New York offices and Irwin Jacobs’ Minneapolis base are direct substitutes for corporate headquarters in Akron
and Peoria.

The ideal arrangement, the LBO Association, was a venture among three
“constituencies”: the sponsoring boutique; senior management with a large
equity stake; and the big institutional investors who fund the deals. Jensen
also celebrated the great innovation “pioneered” by Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond — low-rated, high-risk, high-interest-rate debt that
powered the celebrity deals of the 1980s. Thanks to Drexel’s distribution
network, the ceaselessly innovative Michael Milken, sitting at his X-shaped
desk in Beverly Hills, could invent a deal and place the bonds necessary
to finance it in the Wall Street equivalent of overnight. His network of
S&Ls, insurance companies, mutual funds, and rich individuals, supported
in no small part by their Ponzi-like propensity for buying each others’
paper, was there for his tapping.
KKR was the prototype for Jensen’s new corporate form. In the early
years after its birth on May Day 1976, KKR did modest deals, focusing on
smallish companies (Bartlett 1991).12 The partners would approach a firm,
persuade the managers to borrow a bunch of money, and jointly buy the
firm. They made sure there was plenty of daylight between the cash coming in and the interest payments going out. If all went well, the new owners, full of incentive and energy, would revive the company, and prepare
it for sale some years down the road at vast profits. The scheme worked
like magic. As the years progressed, the partners lusted after bigger and
bigger deals. To swing those, they needed big outside backing, and they
got it, though it took some time to convince the hypercautious that leverage could be so profitable. As early as five years after KKR’s founding,
271

WALL STREET

their investors included Prudential, Aetna, GE’s pension fund, Metropolitan Life, J.P. Morgan, and Northwest Mutual. Later on, they’d recruit the
Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin state pension funds, among others.
So despite its guerrilla-ish image, KKR was backed by the innermost circles
of finance joined by the retirement money of public sector workers.
KKR’s early years were spectacular. The five major buyout funds, organized over 1978–86, paid annual profits of over 32% to their investors
(Bartlett 1991, p. 346). But the 1989 fund, which did the RJR buyout, was a
turkey, returning a mere 4% (Sloan 1994). The new corporate form failed
the crucial test: delivering sustained profits to its investors. The publication of Sarah Bartlett’s (1991) book, which portrayed KKR as putting its
own interests far ahead of those of its investors and its stable of companies, to put it gently, did little to further the buyout boutique’s reputation.
Back, though, to Jensen and his manifesto. It drew a blizzard of responses, mainly from anti-Jensenites. One, from Peter Róna (1989), head
of the IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust in New York, made several points worth
quoting — and Róna’s position as a financier rather than an industrialist
makes his comments especially interesting. First, Róna argued that Jensen
grossly overstated the shareholders’ case. In return for limits on their liability (they can see the value of their stock wiped out, but the rest of their
assets can’t be attached), shareholders give up the right to dispose of corporate property on their own; they can sell the shares, but not the firm’s
assets. By making the shareholder sacrosanct, Jensen preempted any
“thoughtful analysis of the very question that is at the heart of the issue —
what should be the rights and privileges of shareholders?” Second, the
LBO is based on the redistribution today of cash flows expected tomorrow and beyond; if these estimates are wrong, then the public shareholders who are bought out in an LBO have the cash and “everyone else is left
with a carcass.” But shareholders are in the game only to maximize value;
having consummated this goal, “they take pretty much the same view of
the corporation as the praying mantis does of her mate.” Finally, Jensen
assumed that shareholders are better judges of capital projects than are
managers and corporate boards — an “ideologically inspired assertion
that lacks empirical support.” As Róna says, it’s hard to imagine how one
would go about testing this empirically, but “the burden is on Jensen” to
take on the task, “since he has already reported the results.”
Jensen’s (1989b) response to Róna was evasive, offering little to rebut
the charges against him. Jensen did, however, helpfully list some forces
he viewed as obstacles to economic progress: “striking Eastern Air Lines
272

GOVERNANCE

pilots, Pittston Coal miners, [and] New York Telephone employees, who
seem perfectly content to destroy or damage their employer’s organization while attempting to serve their own interests. Ralph Nader’s consumer
activist organization is another example.” (It’s a nice irony that public
employee pension funds were used to smash some of Jensen’s impediments to progress.) The only subclass of Jensen’s society to have a claim
on corporations, it’s clear, are shareholders; workers (managers among
them) and consumers serve only at the owners’ pleasure.
One of the most interesting statements Jensen made on the appropriateness of shareholders to this great social task is actually something he
forgot to say. Defending the RJR Nabisco deal — the bloated climax of the
1980s mania, testimony that his hero Henry Kravis was as vainglorious as
any cash-burning CEO — Jensen (1991) pointed to the firm’s immense
waste of money on perks, sports promotions, and “unproductive capital
expenditures and organizational inefficiencies.” To that phrase is appended
footnote 4:
As revealed in the book [Barbarians at the Gate (Burrough and Helyar
1990, pp. 370–371)], John Greeniaus, head of [CEO Ross] Johnson’s baking
unit, told KKR that if “the earnings of this group go up 15 or 20%…I’d be in
trouble.” His charter was to spend the excess cash in his Nabisco division to
limit earnings in order to produce moderate, but smoothly rising profits —
a strategy that would mask the potential profitability of the business….

Sounds like a perfect example of managerial waste — the kind of planned
mediocrity evoked in Galbraith’s New Industrial State. But curiously, Jensen
failed to report the reason for this profit-masking, revealed right after the
ellipsis: “It was all done, Greeniaus explained, because Wall Street craved
predictability.” When unpredictable things happen, Wall Street comes
unhinged — efficient market theory, which Jensen once famously described
as the best-established principle in all the social sciences, to the contrary.
Shareholders were responsible for planned mediocrity at RJR Nabisco,
something it would be very damaging for Jensen to admit.
Three footnotes later, Jensen (1991, p. 15) got worked up over Susan
Faludi’s (1990) Pulitzer-prize-winning13 Wall Street Journal piece on the
LBO of Safeway, the grocery chain, another KKR deal. The deal, regarded
as one of the leverage movement’s great successes, brought $28 million in
stock profits and $100 million in options to top Safeway execs, $65 million
to the investment bankers, another $25 million to lawyers, and $60 million
in up-front fees for KKR — and pay cuts and unemployment for Safeway
273

WALL STREET

workers. Faludi’s tales of suicide, heart attack, impoverishment, and despair among workers displaced after the buyout were nothing compared
to “long-run efficiency effects” (Jensen 1991, p. 15). To Jude Wanniski
(1990), the Faludi piece was “pure and simple propaganda, the work of
an ideologue using the Journal’s front page to propagate a specific opinion about how corporate America should conduct its affairs.” Wanniski, of
course, is the supply-side ideologue who once used the Journal editorial
page to propagate a specific opinion on how America should conduct its
fiscal affairs, one that all but a handful of unreconstructed maniacs now
regard as a disaster.
A more dispassionate study of a deal Jensen also loved, this one from a
business school and not a business newspaper, also showed harsh effects
on workers. Wayne Landsman and Douglas Shackelford (1993) reported
that of the 2,209 workers who lost their jobs after the RJR buyout, 72% reentered the workforce at 47% of their pre-buyout wages, that women were
more badly hurt than men, and older employees hurt more than younger.
To the buyout apologist, these are not necessarily bad things; they would
probably be taken as evidence that RJR was overstaffed and its workers
overpaid, a waste of money that rightly belongs to shareholders. An LBO
is a form of class struggle.
Besides labor, nature too suffered from the buyout boom. In one study
of 62 hostile takeover bids between 1984 and 1986, for example, an important target was lumber firms who were not cutting enough timber “given
the interest rate, the growth rate of trees, and the price path for timber.”
The infamous Maxxam takeover of Pacific Lumber was inspired by fallow
old redwoods that the latter wouldn’t cut. Maxxam, powered by junk, took
over Pacific Lumber and liquidated the trees. Thinking like economists,
Sanjai Bhagat, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny (1990, p. 54), declared
that “we have a case in which cutting the trees raises efficiency.” And if
trees are not sacrificed at the rate dictated by interest rates, then Wall Street
is being cheated of free cash flow.
Rising to a higher theoretical pitch in his early 1990s work, Jensen likened the “new LBO associations” — those with a KKR-like boutique at the
center — to Japanese keiretsu, which are groups of associated firms with
a large bank at their center (Jensen 1991). But there are important differences between keiretsu and the fabled constellation of LBOs. As Jensen
conceded, Japanese managers don’t own stock (and are quite modestly
paid by U.S. standards), but in his LBO ideal, stock would be the main
form of management compensation.
274

GOVERNANCE

Actually the ownership structure of keiretsu is quite intriguing, and something market socialists as well as social market types should study.14 There
is a bank at the center of each group, but the bank is not the controlling
factor; group members are also heavy holders of their fellow
groupmembers’ shares. There are also extensive board interlocks, with
the main bank typically having a board presence as well. Though members do business — even financial business — with firms outside the group,
they also do major business with each other. Clearly these are complex
organizations with deep financial, personal, and technical ties, not the
narrow owner–owned relation characteristic of Jensen’s LBO associations.
These cross-holdings and interlocks bind the firms together, each keeping an eye on the others; they check for “timeliness of delivery, product
quality, level of investment” — real, telling signs of corporate health that
would elude distant shareholders (Berglöf and Perotti 1994) . In a crisis,
group members come to the aid of a troubled firm, with the bank coming
in only in case of a more serious crisis (typically solved through restructuring or forced merger). The Japanese term for reciprocal shareholdings,
kabushiki mochiai, has the meaning of “mutual help, shared interdependence, and stability.” In the noneconomic literature, the shares are treated
as expressions of mutual trust — signs of the relationship, not the relationship itself. Despite the absence of the takeover threat, managers in
troubled firms are neatly removed — perhaps more so than the U.S. In the
Japanese case, main banks also provide important finance — the opposite emphasis of an LBO matrix, which exists to deliver a fat stream of
interest payments to the sponsors. Berglöf and Perotti also theorize that
having the bank as the responsible party of last resort is an excellent discipline on the group, because the bank must worry about keeping deposits. If the firms under its eye do badly, then depositors may shift their
money elsewhere.15 These ties are now loosening under the pressure of
the long recession that hit Japan after its bubble burst in 1989. It will be
interesting to see how an economic recovery combined with Japanese
government commitments to further financial deregulation will transform
corporate and financial structures in the late 1990s.
In his more recent work, Jensen (1993) has increasingly emphasized
“fundamental technological, political, regulatory, and economic forces”
as the source of 20 years of intense business and social upheaval: deep
reductions in the costs of production, deregulation, “globalization,” “reduced growth rates in labor income, excess capacity, and — ultimately —
downsizing and exit.” Jensen explained the “1895–1904” merger boom as
275

WALL STREET

a form of such exit — the destruction of capital through combination, as
“capacity was reduced through the consolidation and closure of marginal
facilities in merged entities.” That’s been happening again in the 1980s
and 1990s. This is a gloomier message than his tale of the 1980s — more
emphasis is placed on shrinkage than revival — but it’s probably a more
accurate picture of what M&A is all about.
His social message is even harsher. The stress of this New Industrial
Revolution will place “strains…on worldwide social and political systems.”
Luddites or marching armies of the unemployed could threaten the beautiful revolution and might have to be met with same “militia” that “subdued” the Luddites. The harsh medicine must be taken: “We need look no
further than central and eastern Europe or Asia to see the effects of policies that protect organizations from foreign and domestic competition”
(Jensen 1993, p. 845). Unions must be broken, employment made more
tenuous, plants must be closed — and U.S. corporate governance structures are still not up to the task. The crushing of Drexel, the regulatory
murder of the junk bond market, the political backlash against the leverage artists left a vacuum in the disciplinary structure.
Despite his fatuous cheerleading and callous subordination of human
lives to efficiency, it must be said again that Jensen really is onto something important in modern American capitalism, something that is often
denied by his liberal and populist critics. There is constant pressure on
older firms — and given the weakened state of large parts of the mainframe computer business, “older” can be defined pretty liberally — coming both from demanding rentiers and product market competition. Given
the ownership and management structure of U.S. industry, there’s a conflict among stockholders, managers, and workers over how to manage
these strains. Wall Street would like to withdraw capital from these industries — slim them down or eliminate them entirely — and pocket the
money. In high market theory, Wall Street can be relied upon to redeploy
this liberated capital beneficently, and the squeezed industries will either
discover a fountain of youth under the discipline of debt or die. Since the
last 200 pages of this book have argued that Wall Street isn’t up to that
task, the whole finance and governance structure is called into serious
question.
The great advantage of Jensenism is that, when combined with an uncritical acceptance of the efficient market religion, it amounts to a unified
field theory of economic regulation: all-knowing financial markets will
guide real investment decisions towards their optimum, and with the proper
276

GOVERNANCE

set of incentives, owner–managers will follow this guidance without reservation. Many of Jensen’s critics, whether they know or mention him by
name or simply refer to “the 1980s” or downsizing or corporate restructuring, have no coherent response to the problems of overcapacity, obsolescence, or furious competition. In a time when only the brave or foolish
dare criticize capitalism itself, critiques only of a certain style of capitalism
are all that can be uttered. In the 1990s, the rhetoric has changed; now it’s
“technology” and “globalization” that are denounced — but the analysis is
still narrowly drawn and the tone of critique equally timorous.
On a less grand note, another virtue of Jensen’s work is that it challenges the MM theorem. Whether you want to emphasize the positive aspects of debt — its powers to inspire indebted managers — or its negative
ones — the power to bankrupt otherwise healthy corporations — financial structure clearly matters, and matters a lot.

mergers and the market for corporate control
Jensenism is a special case of a broader concept known as the liquid market for corporate control. True religionists believe that while the stock
market imposes a certain discipline on management — if you believe in
efficient market theory, then the stock price is a real-time report card on
corporate management — mere market prices are not enough in extreme
cases. If the stock price gets low enough and management is unwilling or
unable to respond, then the ultimate sanction for incompetence is a takeover, actual or threatened. An LBO can be thought of as one form of this
discipline, but it can take many other forms.
A landmark in the evolution of this line of thinking was Henry Manne’s
(1965) paper “Mergers and the Market for Corporate Control.” The second
part of that title, often modified with “liquid,” was a commonplace of the
1980s popular and academic literature, almost all of it celebratory. The
celebration reached an extraordinary pitch as the leverage boom peaked
in 1989. One measure of that mania is a speech delivered in January of
that year by Roberto Mendoza, then the VP for M&A at the Morgan Bank.
The Morgan, once the epitome of white-shoe propriety, turned more aggressive as the 1980s wore on. After praising the liquid market in corporate control, Mendoza (1989) offered this reflection:
We often read in the press of returns on equity of 800 to 900 percent over a
two- or three-year period. Somehow the bias has taken hold that this is an
excessive return, or that someone is being exploited. We believe that finan-

277

WALL STREET

cial buyers are intelligently using the methodology that many strategic corporate buyers do not use, and that the returns are not excessive; in fact,
they are very reasonable. The financial buyer is using leverage in a creative
and intelligent manner.

Whatever your moral philosophy, returns of 800–900% are not sustainable. But since Mendoza’s argument can be traced in part to Manne’s article, let’s take a look at it.
Traced only in part, though; note Mendoza said that “financial” buyers
rather than “strategic corporate” buyers — that is, bankers and dealmakers,
rather than firms in related industries. Manne’s article was in large measure pitched as an attack on then-prevailing antitrust doctrine, which was
inhibiting mergers among competitors. But Manne also had a larger point
to make — that an open season on corporate managers was a way of
overcoming the problem of the separation of ownership and control.
Manne’s argument was based on efficient market theory before it really
had that name, and the conflation of market and economic notions of
efficiency: “A fundamental premise underlying the market for corporate
control is the existence of a high positive correlation between corporate
managerial efficiency and the market price of shares of that company.”
Poor management makes for a depressed stock, which makes for ripeness
for takeover. While acknowledging in a footnote that market prices are
subject to what later would be called noise, Manne concluded, with the
usual theological fervor, that “over some period of time it would seem that
the average market price of a company’s shares must be the ‘correct’ one.”
Those with the wit and capital (or at least a line of credit) to take advantage of this opportunity can make “enormous” returns from “the successful takeover and revitalization of a poorly run company.” Antitrust doctrine
and other regulations, Manne claimed, were impeding “the mobility of
capital,” and thereby “a more efficient allocation of resources.”
Manne was a professor of law, and most of his citations are of the legal
literature, but his reasoning relied on a theory as pure as that of Modigliani
and Miller. Markets are efficient, and by God, anything that gets in their
way is the enemy of human progress. But do mergers work the magic he
was convinced they did?
No, they don’t seem to. First, a bit of history. Mergers are often grouped
into four major waves — from 1898 to 1904, when the modern giant corporation took shape, often assembled from many smaller firms in the same
industry; the 1920s, a period of further consolidation (or monopolization,
278

GOVERNANCE

in some eyes); the 1960s, the period when conglomerates of unrelated
businesses were fashionable; and the early 1980s to at least the moment in
1996 when these words were written, a period during which many of the
conglomerates were broken apart, and combinations between firms in
the same or related industries predominated. Why mergers should occur
in waves is listed in Brealy and Myers’ (1991, p. 923) finance textbook as
one of the 10 great unsolved mysteries of the field. Whatever the answer
— the orthodox dismiss explanations based on such woolly concepts as
“manias” and “bubbles,” but that explanation seems just fine to me —
there’s no question that mergers do tend to cluster.
For a look at the historical record one could do no better than a special
issue of the International Journal of Industrial Organization published
in 1989. Bad M&A performance goes back a long long way. For example,
despite Manne’s complaints about post-1929 regulations interfering with
the pure market in corporate control, a study of 134 combinations during
the 1920s (Borg, Borg, and Leith 1989) found only “modest success,” with
the average profitability — measured by stock performance of the acquiring firms — little different from mergers during the 1960s and 1970s, despite huge differences in the economic and legal environments, including
the effective suspension of antitrust enforcement after 1920. The earlier
mergers were hardly a model; Borg & Co. quote a 1921 evaluation of the
turn-of-the-century merger wave that showed that in only five of 35 cases
did profits meet or exceed the promises of the promoters in the decade
following the combination.
Studies of actual operating results in a more contemporary environment show similar disappointments. An examination of Federal Trade
Commission records over the period from 1957 to 1977, which allows fairly
detailed study of actual lines of business rather than entire firms, and for
privately held firms with no publicly traded securities — both exceptions
to the rule for most merger studies — showed that profits of acquired
firms tended to decline sharply, a point confirmed by the high rate of
subsequent divestitures for the gobbled-up units (Ravenscraft and Scherer
1989). That study also shows that profits of acquired units were often uncommonly high before the merger; “thus,” the authors conclude, “there is
no broad-gauged support for the ‘inefficient management displacement’
hypothesis that acquired companies were subnormal performers.”
Ravenscraft and Scherer concluded, in typically understated academic style,
that “the evidence mandates considerable skepticism toward the claim
that mergers are on average efficiency-enhancing.”
279

WALL STREET

One reason mergers turn out badly is that acquiring firms pay too much.
An examination of 137 acquisitions done between 1976 and 1984 showed
that acquiring firms paid very optimistic prices for their prey; fair prices
figured on the basis of prevailing rates of return showed that the performance gains necessary to justify the prices paid in takeovers were impossible to achieve in normal industrial experience (Alberts and Varaiya 1989).
A broader review of the evidence by Richard Caves (1989) strengthens
“skepticism toward the claim that mergers are on average efficiency-enhancing.” While there’s no denying that the stockholders of target firms
enjoy fat profits — they gain from the buyers’ overpayments — Caves
concluded that “acquirers realized little profit, and what they did obtain
came mainly in a private but not a social form.” That is, there’s no serious
evidence that mergers are good for the abstraction known as “the
economy,” though parties to the deal occasionally make out like bandits.
Caves also cites British studies showing little productivity gain and frequent losses coming from mergers — something he attributes to “transition costs,” including managerial time taken to make the marriage work
and the distractions to all employees “while everyone conjectures on the
course of the axe’s descent.”
Whatever their track record, mergers and takeovers do offer windfalls
to stockholders of target companies. Where do the gains to stockholders
in takeovers come from? The question is not as silly as it may seem at first.
If the stock market were rationally valuing the target firm then why should
buyers pay significantly more than the prevailing price? If acquirers do
overpay, and shareholders of target firms reap a windfall, who, if anyone,
loses? Many studies have come to many conclusions, but the study of hostile deals in the mid-1980s by Bhagat, Shleifer, and Vishny (1990) offered
a pretty convincing array of possibilities. They attributed some role to layoffs — “important but not…dominant”; more important in their eyes were
tax savings (a byproduct of increased indebtedness); less important were
losses to shareholders of the buying firm (a penalty of overpayment) and
cuts in investment by the target firm. The dismantling of conglomerates
and mergers within industries, they argued, also resulted in improved performance that comes with specialization, and possibly even increased
“market power” (that is, monopoly pricing power). Importantly, though,
the takeover era was
not typically a reflection of a change in the internal organization of the firm.
Management buyouts and acquisitions by raiders are often a temporary step

in the reallocation of assets; they are not a new permanent organizational
form. The eventual holders of assets are large public corporations, which
are not about to be eclipsed (Bhagat, Shleifer, and Vishny 1990, p. 57).

The closing words are an allusion to Jensen’s (1989a) infamously wrong
Harvard Business Review article “Eclipse of the Public Corporation.”
If mergers have such a dismal record, why do they happen? There are
several theories, many of them presented with the usual complexities, but
they all can be boiled down into simple English. Empire-building. Managers feel richer and more powerful if their firm is growing, and if the business can’t grow quickly on its own, then they can gobble up others. Related
to this is the idea that while mergers may not result in a higher rate of
return (profits divided by invested capital), they may result in a higher
quantity of profits, that is more zeroes on the bottom line. Hubris. While
the average merger may be a dog, every now and then one can be extraordinarily successful, and perpetrators are convinced they can be the
lucky ones. Promoters’ interests. Bankers who act as matchmakers make
oodles of money, with fees running around 1% of the value of a large
merger (Du Boff and Herman 1989; Truell 1995); for a routine large merger,
this means fees in the scores of millions, divided among a handful of bankers and lawyers for several weeks’ worth of admittedly intense work.16
Theoretical blindness. Economists repeat the Manne and Jensen mantras
because they must be true, the market must be right, investors must be
rational — all music to investment bankers’ ears, of course.
Or, maybe mergers are ways of managing decline, of withdrawing capital
and players from a saggy sector. In this case it should be no surprise that
mergers don’t do well; even strong firms in a declining industry are still in
a declining industry. The mystery is that stock investors still can’t figure
this out with a century’s track record to study.
Far from figuring it out, Anglo-American capital markets seem more
willing to fund growth by acquisition than through internal growth by
established firms, and they are often shy about financing startups. This
preference, which seems characteristic of Anglo-American style markets
and governance structures, would, it seems reasonable to conclude, depress investment levels and economic growth rates. In a study of British
firms, Manmohan S. Kumar (1984) found that firms financed their internal
growth with internal resources, turning to external finance mainly for acquisitions — acquisitions “did not in the majority of cases have a favourable
impact on profitability” (p. 178). If the capital markets were exercising
281

WALL STREET

their advertised disciplinary function, that finance should not have been
available, but it was.
Saying the “capital markets” haven’t figured out the flimsiness of most
merger rationales obscures the divisions between perpetrators and victims (the rich victims, not those beneath serious consideration, like displaced workers). Specifically, investment bankers do their best to zap the
memories of their clients. Most M&A waves are powered by some financial fad: new issues of watered stock at the turn of the century to finance
the trustification of whole industries; unsecured debt instruments called
debentures (“Chinese paper”) used as the currency of conglomeratization
in the 1960s; junk bonds used to finance the leveraged recapitalizations in
the 1980s. The logic behind this odd and ever-changing flood of paper
was explained by an anonymous investment banker quoted in The Deal
Decade (Blair 1993, p. 298): “Most mergers do not make sense. Therefore
you have to use securities that the buyers do not understand and that are
different from the last round of bad merger securities.”
Some readers may think I’ve contradicted myself; having defended the
growth of the giant corporation against the criminality hypothesis of the
Robber Baron school, I now marshal evidence to show that mergers don’t
work very well. This apparent contradiction is easily resolved. First, merger
isn’t the only way to grow; it may be a second-best approach for firms that
can’t grow on their own. The computer industry today is populated by
firms that didn’t exist 20 years ago — Dell and Compaq, for example.
Acquisition had nothing to do with their entry into the Fortune 500; the
firms grew like wildfire because they produced good machines and marketed them well. Japan has seen much lower levels of M&A than the U.S.
or Britain; Japanese companies have historically relied heavily on internal
growth, with “concomitant benefits to the Japanese economy in the form
of new investment and growth” (Mueller 1989). Second, the efficiency of
the professionally managed large corporation is a separate issue from
growth through acquisition; in most cases, small firms are no match for
the prowess of larger ones, though of course older giants like General
Motors do stumble badly now and then. But most of GM’s problems came
from other giant firms, like Toyota, and not from plucky startups. And
finally, under capitalism, money talks. Small firms don’t have the access to
capital or internally generated profits that big ones do. Big firms have so
much money, in fact, that they can waste it on stupid acquisitions and still
live to tell the story. There’s nothing criminal about that unless you consider the profit system itself criminal.

GOVERNANCE

LBOs in retrospect
LBOs were a special case of the market for corporate control, and enough
time has gone by to pass rigorous judgment on how they worked out.
There seems little doubt that LBO and other restructuring targets were in
slow-growing industries, or underperformers within their industries (Blair
and Schary 1993b, p. 201); most were in low- or mid-tech sectors. Studies
that show cutbacks in investment or R&D by leverage targets may be showing the very intention of the restructurings — to shift capital out of the
hands of managers of slow-growing firms and into Wall Street’s.
William Long and David Ravenscraft (1993a) summarized their own
and others’ findings on LBOs as follows.17 First, a firm was more likely to
be a target during the 1980s if its free cash flow was high, or if management shareownership was high; it was less likely to be targeted if its valuation was high (price/earnings, Tobin’s q), or if did lots of R&D. Second, a
good bit of the premiums paid to shareholders in excess of pre-deal market value came from tax savings. And third, LBOs improved operating
income, though this largely got sucked away by high interest payments,
and reduced capital expenditures and taxes paid. Fourth, employment at
leveraged firms grew at a slower rate than the average of their relevant
industrial sectors. And finally, LBOs experienced a great deal of “financial
distress,” and fell deeply out of fashion.
Long and Ravenscraft also showed a deterioration as the decade went
on. Early-1980s (1981–84) LBOs showed good improvements in profitability); later deals showed a deterioration in performance, though not at
statistically significant levels. Their studies at the plant level, however,
showed no great improvements, meaning that overhead reductions were
the source of most of the cost savings.18 Long and Ravenscraft also demonstrated that deals financed with bank debt greatly outperformed those
done with junk — a rather interesting finding, and one confirmed by Kaplan
and Stein (1993). This is another blow to Jensenmania, and a stroke in
favor of bank over market finance. It’s true that average R&D spending by
LBO targets was low, but that low average hides the fact that almost half
the manufacturing LBOs in Long and Ravenscraft’s (1993c) universe were
considered large R&D performers by the National Science Foundation. In
their sample, R&D declined by 40% after an LBO, and capital expenditures by 9%. Again, such cuts are perfectly in line with the Jensen strategy
of transferring capital from corporate managers to portfolio managers;
whether society is better off is another question.

283

WALL STREET

Elsewhere, Long and Ravenscraft (1993b) reported that while LBOs led
to “substantially” improved operating performance, the gains faded after
three years, and that four to five years after the buyout the firm was back
where it started. But despite the operating improvement, the interest burden took a big bite, leaving net profits after debt service below pre-LBO
levels. Again, that’s perfectly consistent with the Wall Street-fattening strategy, but has little to do with fostering a social renaissance.
In a study of 124 large buyouts between 1980 and 1989, Steven Kaplan
and Jeremy Stein (1993) came to several fundamental conclusions: (1)
prices rose relative to underlying profits or cash flow as the decade proceeded; (2) bank principal repayment requirements stiffened, leading to
less of a cash cushion for interest payments; (3) bank debt was replaced
by junk bonds as the source of outside money; (4) management teams
and dealmakers took ever-larger fees up front; and (5) deals struck later in
the decade were far more likely to experience “distress” — default or
bankrupcy — than those consummated in the early years. Only one of the
41 1980–84 buyouts they studied experienced “distress,” but 30 of 83 (36%)
of the 1985–89 deals did — many of them despite cost-cutting and improved operating profitability. Too much debt can ruin even the best business, but after 1985, these deals were far from good.
This broad picture of 1980s M&A, drawn mainly from detailed studies
of individual deals, is confirmed by economy-wide data as well. Going
into the 1980s, corporate America was deeply undervalued. The stockonly version of Tobin’s q ratio (the value of equity divided by underlying
tangible assets) averaged 34% between 1974, the depth of the post-OPEC
bear market, and 1982, the year the great 1980s bull market began, just
over half its historical average.19 As the decade wore on, however, the q
rose sharply — to 47% in 1986, and 60% in 1989, when the leverage boom
ended (flow of funds data). Mergers have continued since at even higher
q’s, but with nowhere near the degree of leverage; you’d have to be insane — or have a high tolerance of risk, to put it more coolly — to borrow
heavily to pay prices like 1996’s. Cash and stock are the currency of 1990s
deals; firms still have plenty of free cash flow. The mergers may not work
out in the long run, but at least they won’t leave any debt tailings that
could turn toxic over time; only the stockholders are at risk.
Deals became more overpriced and riskier at the same time the commitments of managers and financiers to the deals were weakening. High
up-front fees encourage irresponsible deal making — book the deal now,
the hell with long-term prospects. Tighter repayment schedules meant
284

GOVERNANCE

that asset sales — selling off pieces of a company — rather than improvements in profitability were central to the financing strategy — the very
definition of Minsky’s Ponzi financial structure. The inferior performance
of the public junk bond market suggests that bank lenders are better judges
of credit than are mutual fund managers and other portfolio jugglers.
The whole picture of bigger, dumber deals as the buyout binge matured is a severe blow to notions of efficient markets; the whole affair with
leverage looks in retrospect like one of the great financial bubbles of all
time. But it was a bubble with a flossy intellectual pedigree, deep support
from the government (both the elected one and the Federal Reserve) and
financial establishment, and with damaging consequences to the real U.S.
economy. None of the perpetrators — investment bankers, finance academics, or central bankers — have suffered any blow to their prestige.
And none of the governance issues raised by Jensen and his comrades
have been solved; we know now that the LBO association hasn’t become
the new model of business organization, but shareholders are still conniving to get a bigger share of corporate cash flow.

detour: on Felix
I said earlier that liberals and populists denounced the buyout mania as
an outburst of greed without analyzing any of its underlying mechanisms.
One of their favorite voices of outrage was a Wall Streeter, the soulful
banker, Felix Rohatyn, whose position presumably gave him some authority, an authority that couldn’t survive a serious confrontation with his
résumé. Rohatyn — author of tedious, moralizing pieces in the New York
Review of Books, supplier of sermon-like quotes to press hacks, failed
perennial Democratic candidate for Treasury Secretary, and now something of a has-been — was actually the inspiration for one of the 1980s’
dashingest figures, Joe Perella. Perella, partner with Bruce “Bid ’em Up”
Wasserman in one of the great buyout machines of the time, told
Institutional Investor in 1984: “I saw Felix knocking off those mergers at
$1 million a clip, with no capital. I was impressed not only with his skill
but also by the sheer potential of M&A fees” (quoted in Henwood 1990).
Felix, together with his mentor André Meyer, put together ITT and other
great 1960s conglomerates at Lazard Frères. Rohatyn and Meyer helped
turn Steve Ross from a parking-lot operator into the capo of Warner Bros.
Lazard was the first to break the $1 million banking fee, but Meyer
wanted nothing to do with the mundane business of underwriting securities to finance real companies; he liked playing with whole companies
285

WALL STREET

better. In 1963, Meyer, “with his taste for the sure thing,” bought a French
company operating in Wyoming named, appropriately enough, Franco
Wyoming, liquidated it and fired all the employees and practically overnight made a 300% profit. A name-brand investment bank bought a company, busted it up, and got away with a huge profit and its reputation
intact; this was a lesson not lost on Wall Street (Reich 1983, pp. 243–247).
Later, Rohatyn would denounce such practices and urge the creation of
a Reconstruction Finance Corporation to retool America. A dealmaker who
did virtually nothing to fund productive investment, Rohatyn frequently
urged the government to take on the mundane business of industrial finance, clearly too demeaning a task for the sophisticates of Wall Street. As
the novelist–polemicist Michael Thomas put it (personal communication),
Felix pounds the pulpit with one hand and endorses checks with the other.

going bust
As the 1980s faded, it became clear that the LBO association was not about
to replace the public corporation. Despite a burst of M&A activity in the
mid-1990s after a lull early in the decade, the dominant transaction was a
merger between large public corporations, or the absorption of one unit
of a public corporation by another public corporation. A new form of
rentier assertiveness came forward in the 1990s as the boutiques and lone
operators faded — shareholder activism.
Jensen and his ilk blame the collapse of the buyout movement on regulators and the media. By jailing Milken, busting Drexel, and reining in the
S&Ls, these spoilsports snuffed the only hope for the restructuring of corporate America. In fact, the movement did itself in. A wave of defaults in
1988 and 1989 followed by the near implosion of the U.S. economy in the
early 1990s scared all but the loopiest away from experiments in leverage.
In an interview, Jensen expressed great regret that Drexel was not
around to finance Kirk Kerkorian’s spring 1995 attempt to take over
Chrysler. Kerkorian said the automaker was sitting on piles of cash, but
Chrysler defended itself by saying it was husbanding resources for the
next recession. Jensen said that if Kerkorian had succeeded, debt would
have sucked away this cash, which has made Chrysler management “fat,
bloated, dumb, and happy.” With less cash, the firm would shut inefficient plants (which it should do rather than increase capacity, despite robust demand), and drive a harder bargain with labor and suppliers. To
Jensen, Chrysler’s greatest moments were when it was near death, and
was driven by fear to invent great new efficiencies.20 (Of course, a loan
286

GOVERNANCE

from the U.S. government didn’t hurt either.) But, alas, there was no Drexel,
and bankers shied away from financing Kerkorian’s attack. It was a firm
sign that the 1980s were still too fresh in too many minds for a revival.
Maybe in five or fifteen years, but not in 1995.
The main reason that the leverage strategy was so discredited is the
insolvency boom graphed nearby, one of the greatest in U.S. history, rivaled only by the deflations of the late 19th century and early 1930s. Jensen
himself had argued that going bust wouldn’t really be much of a problem
for leveraged firms; the new structure, he asserted, would give rise to the
“privatization” of bankruptcy — out-of-court arrangements among the
handful of players in an LBO, a contrast with the usual big, expensive
court fight between fragmented groups of creditors and shareholders.

A study by the New York Fed made this observation on the insolvency
boom: “Evidence suggests that in 1990–92, U.S. corporations found managing their debt in a period of weak cash flows more difficult than anticipated. Perhaps managers took seriously the argument that highly leveraged
firms with weak cash flows could generally reorganize their debt without
resorting to bankruptcy” (Remolona et al. 1992–93, p. 3). The last sentence is marked by a footnote to congressional testimony by Jensen.
Actually, Jensen seems to have had half, or maybe a quarter, of a point
on bankruptcy’s privatization. While statistics on the costs of bankruptcy
are surprisingly hard to come by, one study of corporate insolvencies between 1986 and 1993 (Betker 1995) showed that the cost of a classic Chapter
11 corporate bankruptcy averaged 3.93% of pre-bankruptcy assets, but an
LBO or similar leveraged restructuring of the Jensenite sort generally
knocked about 1.3 percentage points off the total. Still, all these
restructurings — whether a classic Chapter 11 or an intimate Jensen-style
287

WALL STREET

affair — still left leveraged firms under heavy debt. Many 1980s deals went
through two bankruptcies. Rajesh Aggharwal (1995) argued that that happened because creditors were unwilling to forgive enough debt to make a
firm viable; they feared that if they forgave, someone else (like a nonparticipating creditor) would gain what they lost.

rioting rentiers
The failure of the LBO movement to transform the fundamental nature of
the corporate form left shareholders at a bit of a loss. Not satisfied with
one of the great long-term bull markets in U.S. history, they continued to
whine about “unlocking shareholder value” hidden in the crevices of corporate America. Since leverage turned out to be a very risky way of liberating those hidden dollars, a new strategy was in order.
As the decade turned, that strategy turned out to be shareholder activism. Ironically, one of the early signs of the new activism was the antiapartheid movement’s pressure on universities, churches, public pension
funds, and other institutional investors to sell the shares of firms doing
business in South Africa. This was a marked departure from the classic
passivity of institutional shareholders. But the entirely laudable goal of
using financial weapons to end official racism was then quickly eclipsed
by more mundane concerns — pressing tired managements to liven up
their companies and thereby drive the stock price northwards.
A curious personal tale of the evolution of the new financial assertiveness
is the career of T. Boone Pickens, who was one of the commandantes of
the first wave of the shareholder rebellion. His stab at Gulf was one of the
great early moments of the deal decade. During the 1980s, Pickens made
relentless fun of CEOs like Andrew Sigler, the boss of Champion International who was managerial America’s mouthpiece while the likes of Pickens
were wilding their way across the corporate landscape. While Sigler argued that “society” owned firms, not “shareholders,” Pickens countered
that shareholder value was all. His oil company didn’t really drill much —
he preferred to explore for oil on the New York Stock Exchange, by buying up other companies with borrowed money (Henwood 1987).
Companies that tried to block takeovers with poison pills and other
schemes were Pickens’ great enemies.21 But in 1995, Mesa found itself
under attack by hostile suitors including Pickens’ former sidekick David
Batchelder. Rather than take his own medicine, Pickens had the board
adopt a poison pill. Mesa’s arguments sound like Sigler’s a decade earlier
— the outside group was in it just for a quick buck. Pickens’ defense: “his
288

GOVERNANCE

days of trying to take over other companies were long gone and that he
hated to be called a corporate raider. ‘The last time I was involved in a
deal was almost 10 years ago,’ he said. ‘There’s no way anybody could
characterize me as anything other than a hard working oilman” (Myerson
1995b). Hard work needn’t guarantee reward; between 1985 and 1995,
Mesa’s stock fell 63%, while the overall market rose 171%. By Pickens’
own standard, he was a disgrace. He was finally ousted in 1996.
Pickens was behind an attempt to organize small shareholders into a formal pressure group, the United Shareholders Association, cutely abbreviated
USA. From its 1986 founding to its 1993 dissolution, USA tracked the performance of large public corporations and compiled a Target 50 list of
losers. The USA would try to negotiate with the underperformers, urging
them to slim down, undo anti-takeover provisions, and just deliver their
shareholders more “value.” If satisfaction wasn’t forthcoming, USA would
ask its 65,000 members to sponsor shareholder resolutions to change governance structures. USA-inspired resolutions were often co-sponsored by
groups like the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the
College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), and the New York City Employees
Retirement System (Nycers). In a measure of the smallness of economists’
minds, one study discovered that in “the two-day event window [after its
announcement]…the average USA-sponsored agreement results in an abnormal stock price reaction of approximately 0.9%. This abnormal return
represents a gain in shareholder wealth of approximately $54 million…”
(Strickland, Wiles, and Zenner 1994). In tiny steps does progress come.
USA was dissolved by its board because as its president, Ralph
Whitworth, put it, it was not USA’s goal to stay “around indefinitely as a
corporate watchdog activism organization…. Boone Pickens founded USA
in the spirit of change — an organization that would set goals, take action,
and get things done” (Strickland, Wiles, and Zenner 1994). This suggests
that even with visibility, membership, and funding, it’s near impossible to
get small, dispersed shareholders to act as a unit. It may pay a big-time
raider to play this game, but certainly not small holders, and apparently
not even small holders banded together.
In 1995, Whitworth joined with Pickens’ former associate Batchelder to
form Relational Investors, a San Diego-based fund designed to invest in
poorly performing companies and act as a “catalyst for change.” They
were backed by a number of large institutional investors, including Calpers,
the most prominent of the shareholder activists. Press reports explain that
this move is part of a new phase in Calpers’ corporate governance pro289

WALL STREET

gram, a way of pressing underperformers to change their ways of doing
business. This, it seems, is the model for the mid-1990s. The heirs of Pickens
are now the prowling agents of public pension funds, looking for value,
ready to prod more than pounce.22
It’s surprising how few pension funds have led the rebellion. Most prominent is Calpers, with a handful of other public pension funds at their side.
Useem (1996, p. 56) noted that these funds — controlled by elected officials and held in the name of public sector workers — find it easy to adopt
an “antimanagement rhetoric, especially when directed against big business.” Their agenda, though, looks much less radical than the rhetoric.
The strictly governance aspects of this agenda typically include: bringing
more outsiders on to the board, in the name of independence; shrinking
large boards (15 or more) down to around a dozen, on the theory that
large boards are more scattered, and therefore more easily dominated by
management; encouraging more scrutinty of management strategy by
outside directors; removing obstacles to takeovers in corporate charters;
and tying executive and director pay to stock performance, rather than
paying flat (and fat) salaries (Salmon 1993; Useem 1996, Chapter 7).
More broadly, these moves have translated into the famed downsizing
and investment cutbacks of the first half of the 1990s; the point of the
governance agenda, after all, is to increase shareholder wealth by increasing shareholder control. Public justifications for these downsizings have
almost always pointed to technological change and global competition,
which takes human interest and agency out of the picture, but in fact the
proximate cause has more often been pressure for higher stock prices
coming from Wall Street portfolio managers.
Institutional investors have made their presence felt most famously
through annual hit lists, like Calpers’, and another drawn up by the Council of Institutional Investors, a consortium of 100 major pension funds with
some $800 billion in assets. Such public humiliations, which have led to
boardroom shakeups at household-name firms, have their effects not only
on the named targets, but also on the managers of other firms, who get the
message and take appropriate action to avoid being on next year’s list. As
Calpers’ general counsel, Richard Koppes, said, “You focus on a few visible ones and make everyone else nervous” (quoted in Berenbeim 1994,
p. 29). But aside from these visible struggles, pension fund managers have
also worked behind the scenes, pressing their wish lists on often recalcitrant managements, and in some cases, meeting with firms’ outside directors, pushing the case for managerial revolution (Lublin 1995b; Useem
290

GOVERNANCE

1996, p. 108). According to a Conference Board survey, executives from
86% of large U.S. firms were contacted by their institutional shareholders;
almost half reported an increase in the number of shareholder calls, with
few reporting a decrease (Berenbeim 1994).
Why have the public pension funds, and only a handful of them at that,
been prominent in the shareholder rebellion, to the exclusion of other
institutional investors? There are several reasons. Private pension funds
are inhibited by conflicts of interest, actual or potential; GM’s pension
fund would have a hard time taking a visible position on a management
shakeup at Chrysler. More broadly, since corporate pension funds are ultimately run by CEOs, the chieftains are not eager to stoke challenges to
their authority. Mutual funds have also shied away from governance issues; Fidelity, it’s said by someone in the know, tried it and withdrew
because of bad press, but the company didn’t return phone calls asking
for comment. Firms like mutual funds with highly visible public images
don’t want to get caught up in public controversies. But it’s highly likely
that many of the nonparticipating institutions are happy to have the activist funds in the lead, doing their work for them; they get the benefit of
higher share prices without having to take the trouble, or risk their public
image by pushing a controversial agenda.

shareholders — who needs them?
Just because Wall Street’s short-termism is a cliché doesn’t mean it isn’t
true. In surveys, CEOs and corporate investor relations managers repeatedly complain of pressure from money managers and Wall Street analysts
to produce quick profit growth. This is no special pleading coming from a
formerly pampered class; money managers themselves confirm to surveytakers that their colleagues are too obsessed with quarter-to-quarter news,
and take too little heed of long-term prospects. It can hardly be otherwise,
since most big investment managers are graded on their quarterly performance. (Useem 1996). Still, stroking these portfolio jockeys takes a lot of
managerial time. CEOs of big U.S. corporations hold six meetings a month
with money managers and stock analysts, and chief financial officers (CFOs)
hold over twice as many; from that, it’s been estimated that CFOs spend
20% of their work time courting Wall Street (Baker et al. 1994). Surely they
have something better to do with their time than spending it with people
who earn big fees for underperforming the averages.
That set holds CEOs to some strange standards indeed. Confirming
Keynes’s theorizing of 60 years ago, expectations often matter more than
291

WALL STREET

actual results. Perversely, one study cited by Useem (1996, p. 88) shows
that “company shortfalls in meeting analyst forecasts are better predictors
of [top] executive dismissal than are shortfalls in the actual earnings. Put
differently, you are more likely to lose your job if you shock investor sensibilities than if you dock company earnings.” And these are the folks who
want an even bigger piece of the action.
As Charles Wohlstetter (1993), former chair of Contel, put it, “In sum,
we have a group of people with increasing control of the Fortune 500
who have no proven skills in management, no experience at selecting
directors, no believable judgment in how much should be spent for research or marketing — in fact, no experience except that which they have
accumulated controlling other people’s money.”
Pension funds are the least regulated of the major institutional investors, which is one reason they’ve been active in the shareholder rebellion,
but this makes them accountable on none but purely financial measures.
So rather than solving the agency problem, activist shareholding simply
adds another layer of potential irresponsibility.
And what do they really have to contribute? The best periods of U.S.
economic growth have occurred when managers ran corporations and
shareholders kept their mouths shut. Admittedly there’s a chicken–egg
problem here; it’s no accident that Berle and Means’ book came out during the Depression, that governance issues receded during the Golden
Age, and that they returned as economic performance deteriorated in the
1970s. But the point is that there’s no evidence that shareholder intervention promotes better performance over the long term — better performance, that is, for anyone but shareholders.23
Apologists love to finesse this distinction, treating higher share prices
as synonymous with a higher social return. But one could argue that by
reducing the funds available for real investment, increasing the return to
shareholders will depress growth and employment over the long term. It’s
likely that investment projects or R&D that shareholders might condemn
as “uneconomic” would nonetheless leave society as a whole better off.
When I asked Useem what purpose stockholders serve, he answered,
wrongly, that they’re an important source of capital. I’ve devoted a good
bit of this book to showing that the signals emitted by the stock market are
either irrelevant or harmful to real economic activity, and that the stock
market itself counts for little or nothing as a source of finance. Shareholders should be vestigial; they have no useful role. Instead, they have grown
increasingly assertive over the last 15 or 20 years, disguising themselves
292

GOVERNANCE

behind a rhetoric of democracy, independence, and accountability.
Shareholders love to present themselves as the ultimate risk-bearers.
But their liabilities are limited by definition to what they paid for the shares,
they can always sell their shares in a troubled firm, and if they have diversified portfolios, they can handle an occasional wipeout with hardly a
stumble. Employees, and often customers and suppliers, are rarely so wellinsulated. Add to this Keynes’s argument that the notion of liquidity cannot apply to a community as a whole, and you have a very damaging
critique of shareholder-centered governance: what’s divine for rentiers is
bad news for everyone else.
Apologists for the rentier agenda also argue that “them are us”: the
portfolio managers demonized as greedy Wall Streeters are really managing all of society’s savings for the long-term interest of all.24 The figures on
concentration of stock ownership presented in Chapter 2 make that argument hard to sustain, but apologists also point to the pension benefits that
we’ll all collect someday if we’re lucky enough to make it to 65 or 67. This
too is devious. Pension assets, while less concentrated than other forms of
financial holdings, are still concentrated; under 40% of the workforce is
covered by a pension plan (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1995, p. 383) and
the richest 10% control 62% of pension assets (Wolff 1996). It seems odd
that workers should be asked to trade a few extra percentage points return on their pension fund, on which they may draw some decades in the
future, for 30 or 40 years of falling wages and rising employment insecurity. The point of “shareholder activism” is to increase the profit share of
national income, and to claim a larger portion of that profit share for rentiers.
Any gains to people of modest means are accidental.
Maybe the present wave of shareholder assertiveness will wane; the
temptation to sell a stock rather than take the trouble of lobbying management may eventually triumph over the apparently meager gains to activism. It may be that even with the institutionalization of ownership,
shareholding still remains too dispersed to sustain the kind of “relationship investing” advocated by Calpers, the Twentieth Century Fund (1992),
or Robert Monks (1995). Professional rentiers and their bankers will no
doubt find a new fad designed to unlock shareholder value, and devise a
fresh set of arguments for why their enrichment is synonymous with the
common good.
Aside from Margaret Blair — though she is far more measured than I —
no prominent student of corporate governance has drawn the obvious
conclusion from all this research: if outside shareholders serve no useful
293

WALL STREET

purpose, then there is no better argument for turning firms over to their
workers.25 Of course, the shareholders don’t see this solution as obvious,
but that’s another story.
governing governments
This chapter and this book have mainly been about the private sector, but
it would be incomplete to finish a chapter on “governance” without looking at the relations between Wall Street and government, not only in the
U.S., but on a world scale.
One advantage that Wall Street has in public economic debate, aside
from its immense wealth and power, is that it’s one of the few institutions
that look at the economy as a whole. American economic policymaking,
like the other kinds, is largely the result of a clash of interest groups, with
every trade association pleading its own special case. Wall Streeters presume to care about how all the pieces come together into a macroeconomy.
The broadest policy techniques — fiscal and monetary policy — are central Wall Street concerns. For some reason, intellectuals like the editors of
the New York Review of Books and the Atlantic have decided that investment bankers like Felix Rohatyn and Peter Peterson have thoughts worth
reading. Not surprisingly, both utter a message of austerity — the first
with a liberal, and the second with a conservative, spin — hidden behind
a rhetoric of economic necessity. These banker–philosophers, creatures
of the most overpaid branch of business enterprise, are miraculously presented as disinterested policy analysts.
Wall Street’s power becomes especially visible during fiscal crises, domestic and international. On a world scale, the international debt crisis of
the 1980s seemed for a while like it might bring down the global financial
system, but as it often does, finance was able to turn a crisis to its own
advantage.
While easy access to commercial bank loans in the 1970s and early
1980s allowed countries some freedom in designing their economic policies (much of it misused, some of it not), the outbreak of the debt crisis in
1982 changed everything. In the words of Jerome I. Levinson (1992), a
former official of the Inter-American Development Bank:
[To] the U.S. Treasury staff…the debt crisis afforded an unparalleled opportunity to achieve, in the debtor countries, the structural reforms favored by
the Reagan administration. The core of these reforms was a commitment

294

GOVERNANCE

on the part of the debtor countries to reduce the role of the public sector as
a vehicle for economic and social development and rely more on market
forces and private enterprise, domestic and foreign.

Levinson’s analysis is seconded by Sir William Ryrie (1992), executive vice
president of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private sector arm. “The debt crisis could be seen as a blessing in disguise,”
he said, though admittedly the disguise “was a heavy one.” It forced the
end to “bankrupt” strategies like import substitution and protectionism,
which hoped, by restricting imports, to nurture the development of domestic industries.26 “Much of the private capital that is once again flowing
to Latin America is capital invested abroad during the run-up to the debt
crisis. As much as 40–50 cents of every dollar borrowed during the 1970s
and early 1980s…may have been invested abroad. This money is now
coming back on a significant scale, especially in Mexico and Argentina.”
In other words, much of the borrowed money was skimmed by ruling
elites, parked profitably in the Cayman Islands and Zürich, and Third World
governments were left with the bill. When the policy environment changed,
some of the money came back home — often to buy newly privatized
state assets for a song.
That millions suffered to service these debts seems to matter little to
Ryrie. Desperate Southern governments had little choice but to yield to
Northern bankers and bureaucrats. Import substitution was dropped, state
enterprises were privatized, and borders were made porous to foreign
investment. After Ryrie’s celebrated capital inflow, Mexico suffered another debt crisis in 1994 and 1995, which was “solved” using U.S. government and IMF guarantees to bail out Wall Street banks and their clients,
and creating a deep depression; to make the debts good, Mexicans would
have to suffer. Once again, a dire financial/fiscal crisis — the insolvency
of an overindebted Mexican government — was used to further a capitalfriendly economic agenda.
These fortunate uses of crisis first appeared in their modern form during New York City’s bankruptcy workout of 1975. This is no place to review the whole crisis; let it just be said that suddenly the city found its
bankers no longer willing to roll over old debt and extend fresh credits.
The city, broke, could not pay. In the name of fiscal rectitude, public services were cut and real fiscal power was turned over to two state agencies, the Municipal Assistance Corp. (MAC, chaired by Rohatyn), and the
Emergency Financial Control Board, since made permanent with the Emer295

WALL STREET

gency dropped from its name. Aside from the most routine municipal functions, the city no longer governed itself; a committee of bankers and their
delegates did, Rohatyn first among them. Rohatyn, who would later criticize Reaganism for being too harsh, was the director of its dress rehearsal
in New York City. Public services were cut, workers were laid off, and the
physical and social infrastructure was left to rot. But the bonds, thank
god, were paid, though not without a little melodrama, gimmickry, and
delay (Lichten 1986, Chapter 6).
The city was admittedly borrowing irresponsibly — though the lenders, it must be said, were lending irresponsibly as well. When a bubble is
building, neither side has an incentive to stop its inflation. But when it
broke, all the pain of adjustment fell on the citizen–debtors. The pattern
would be repeated in the Third World debt crisis, in many U.S. cities over
the next 20 years, and, most recently, with the federal budget.
Obviously the bankers have the advantage in a debt crisis; they hold
the key to the release of the next post-crisis round of finance. Anyone
who wants to borrow again, and that includes nearly everyone, must go
along. But that’s not their only advantage. The sources of their power
were cited by Jac Friedgut of Citibank (ibid., p. 192):
We [the banks] had two advantages [over the unions]…. One is that since
we were dealing on our home turf in terms of finances, we knew basically
what we were talking about, and we knew and had a better idea what it
takes to reopen the market or sell this bond or that bond…. The second
advantage is that we do have a certain noblesse oblige or tight and firm
discipline. So that we could marshal our forces, and when we spoke to the
city or the unions we could speak as one voice…. Once a certain basic
process has been established that’s an environment in which our intellectual leadership…can be tolerated or recognized…we’re able to get things
effected.

It’s plain from Friedgut’s remarkably candid language that to counter this,
one needs expertise, discipline, and the nerve and organization to challenge the “intellectual leadership” of such supremely self-interested parties. But the city unions had none of this. According to the union boss
Victor Gotbaum (in an interview with Robert Fitch, which Fitch relayed to
me), the unions’ main expert at the time, Jack Bigel, didn’t understand the
budgetary issues at all, and deferred to Rohatyn, whom he trusted to do
the right thing. For the services rendered to municipal labor, the onceCommunist Bigel was paid some $750,000 a year, enough to buy himself a
296

GOVERNANCE

posh Fifth Avenue duplex (Zweig 1996). Gotbaum became a close friend
of Felix Rohatyn. Politically, the unions were weak, divided, self-protective, unimaginative, and with no political ties to ordinary New Yorkers.
Actually they did speak in one voice, that of surrender. It’s easy to see why
the bankers won.
What was at stake in New York was no mere bond market concern. In
a classic 1976 New York Times op-ed piece, L.D. Solomon, then publisher
of New York Affairs, wrote: “Whether or not the promises…of the 1960’s
can be rolled back…without violent social upheaval is being tested in
New York City…. If New York is able to offer reduced social services without civil disorder, it will prove that it can be done in the most difficult
environment in the nation.” Thankfully, Solomon concluded, “the poor
have a great capacity for hardship” (quoted in Henwood 1991).
Behind a “fiscal crisis” lurked an entire class agenda, one that has been
quite successfully prosecuted in subsequent crises for the next two decades. But since these are fought on the bankers’ terrain, using their language, they instantly win the political advantage, as nonbankers retreat in
confusion, despair, or boredom in the face of all those damned numbers.
At the national level, rampant borrowing by the U.S. government
throughout the 1980s and early 1990s stimulated a boom for a while, but
ended with the austerity packages of the mid-1990s. Tripling the outstanding load of federal debt not only made Wall Street a lot of money — underwriting, trading, and holding the bonds — it greatly increased rentier
influence over policy. The opinion of “the markets” — essentially the richest
1–2% of Americans and the professionals who manage their money — is
now the final word on economic and social policy. Liberals and populists
who are sanguine about deficit financing should recall Friedgut’s words:
creditors speak with one voice, and they’re able to get things effected.
Those effects generally involve enriching the creditors at the expense of
everyone else.

something more virtual.

employer–employee example so prominently, rather than, say, “the contracts that enable the organizers of the firm to direct the use of capital (equipment or money) by
acquiring, leasing, or borrowing it” (Williamson and Winter 1993, p. 65). But the relation of managers and external financiers is a lot more complex; one party is rarely able
to tell the other to do something as easily as the boss moves Coase’s employee from Y
to X. Interestingly, the legal text that Coase quoted from, Batt’s The Law of Master and
Servant, used classical legal language that makes the power relationship much clearer
than the modern “employer–employee” dyad. Writing in the 1930s, Coase used both
pairs of words; writing in the 1980s, he used only the euphemism.
Inefficiently small scale production may be a problem with a long pedigree in Britain.
In a case study of a Manchester cotton enterprise from 1798 to 1827, Harvey James
(1996) argued that the lack of outside capital (and the reliance entirely on internal
funds for expansion) kept the scale of the firm too small for maximum efficiency.
This historical sketch follows Berle and Means 1932/1967, Book II, Chapter 1.
Of course, interest group models owe as much to myth as fact; some interests, like
bondholders and developers, are more poweful than others, like welfare moms.
One critique of employee stock ownership plans is that they force workers to put a
large portion of their savings into a single asset, and one in which they were already
“invested” through their jobs. If the firm fails, they would lose not only their jobs, but
all their savings as well.
Cost of capital is usually figured as the expected returns on a company’s outstanding
securities — that is, the average of the stock returns required by investors and the
interest rate paid on the firm’s debts. Equity return is usually figured using the CAPM or
similar models; actual interest rates are used to figure the cost of debt (Brealey and
Myers 1991, Chapter 9). Surveys show that firms actually have a “hurdle rate” — a
minimum rate of return necessary for an investment project to be undertaken — well
above their cost of capital. For example, Poterba and Summers (1991) reported that the
firms they surveyed used a hurdle rate of 12.2% after inflation — far far above the longterm real return of 7% on stocks and 2% on bonds. The authors observed that “these
disparities raise an important question about the link between the variables that financial economists focus on in measuring the cost of capital, and the actual practices of
firms.” A hurdle rate this high guarantees an epidemic of free cash flow, since the
average profitable corporation will throw off much more money than it should reinvest
according to this standard.
On the other hand, managers, as Jeremy Stein (1989) argues, may deliberately
underinvest, leaving themselves a degree of financial slack, in order to insulate themselves from the scrutiny of capital markets. But the overall economy might be better off
if the slack funds were fully invested.
The typical financial structure of a firm after a leveraged buyout is equity, 5–20%; senior debt, 40–70%; junior debt, 10–30% (Borio 1990, p. 36). In a crisis, first the equity
holders would get wiped out, then the junior debtholders; if things went well, the
junior debtholders would live to see the high interest payments successfully made, and
the stock would rise sharply in value. Of course, those stock gains would merely be on
paper, unless the holdings were privately sold or the firm were to go public again.
Max Holland’s (1989) study When The Machine Stopped, paints a highly unflattering
portrait of an early KKR deal, the buyout of the machine toolmaker Houdaille Industries — a sad tale of industrial decline and financier rapacity. But investors in the KKR
fund that financed the Houdaille buyout did smashingly; too bad the American tool
industry hasn’t done as well.

show that a bunch of mainstream worthies took it seriously, an index of the shift of
elite opinion against Jensen and Kravis as the decade turned. A similar piece by Bill
Adler (1988) in the Texas Observer garnered no such notice; Faludi says she didn’t
learn of Adler’s piece until she was well along in her research (Rothmyer 1991).
Older financial keiretsu include Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo, with ancestors in
the pre-World War II zaibatsu; the looser, newer groups include Fuyo, Sanwa, and
DKB. The zaibatsu themselves have roots in 19th century family firms that diversified.
It should be emphasized that keiretsu are not cartels; they compete quite intensely in
the domestic Japanese market.
In the mid-1990s, it became very fashionable to denounce Japanese practices and celebrate American ones, because of Japan’s lingering recession after its financial bubble
burst in 1989. This conveniently overlooks Japan’s extraordinary growth in the five
decades following World War II — from an average income equal to 11% of the U.S. in
1945 to 86% of the U.S. in 1994 (Maddison 1995, table D-1a).
As was pointed out earlier, fees during the recent (post-1980) merger wave have probably totaled between $20 billion and $40 billion. Fees for individual deals can be truly
breathtaking; Lazard Frères billed the airline pilots’ union $8.25 million for advising
them on their failed buyout bid for United Airlines — a deal whose collapse brought
about a mini-crash in the stock market in October 1989. That sum works out to $41,045
per banker per day — on a busted deal (Henwood 1990). Even if they worked around
the clock, that’s an hourly rate of $1,710.
Long and Ravenscraft’s study covered several hundred LBOs consummated between
1981 and 1987; the exact number varies from 192 to 821, depending on the data series
in question. It uses quite detailed Census data at the firm and plant level. There were 91
1981–84 LBOs, and 107 1985–87 deals.
Margaret Blair said in an interview that most of the firm- and economy-wide gains in
productivity claimed by buyout partisans were the result of shutting weaker plants,
rather than of an improvement in the performance of sites that remained open. Improving productivity at ongoing operations is a very complicated task.
Low q’s are often associated with mergers. For example, targets of “predatory” acquisitions during the 1960s were disproportionally low-q firms (Barber, Palmer, and Wallace
1994).
In the same interview, Jensen claimed that GM was overstaffed by 25–50%. He didn’t
disclose how he knew this.
“Poison pills” are an antitakeover tactic that kick in when a firm is under attack by a
hostile suitor. Specifically, they are warrants to buy the firm’s stock at a bargain rate
that are issued to existing shareholders once a hostile suitor has accumulated a specified amount of stock. The intent is to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
A legal reason for the new institutional assertiveness was a set of important changes in
securities regulation in 1992 that made it much easier for shareholders to unite and
submit proxy resolutions that force other shareholders to vote on corporate policy or
board makeup, and also made it legal for a group of shareholders to lobby their colleagues and present a case to management. Restrictions on communications among
shareholders were first imposed to prevent big guys from putting small holders at a
disadvantage, but small fry have not yet objected to the new regime, no doubt because
the lobbying efforts seem to have led to higher share prices (Blair 1995, pp. 70–73).
An announcement that a firm is the target of a governance campaign by institutional
shareholders boosts its share price in the short term, but provides little long-term gain
in either share price or profitability (Gillian and Starks 1995; Wahal 1995). But of course,
shareholder assertiveness takes many more forms than such public finger-pointing.
Robert Monks (1995), a former Reaganite who is an eager polemicist on behalf of share299

WALL STREET

holder rights, is imaginative enough to argue that since pension funds represent the
masses’ capital, they are the institutions to which corporations should be accountable.
(By pension funds he means their managers, of course.) This accountability represents
a check on what Monks admits to be the rather anomalous position of corporations in
a professedly democratic society.
25. The Twentieth Century Fund’s (1992) most recent take on governance, Who’s Minding
the Store?, is built around an essay by Robert Shiller on excess volatility. Yet the policy
conclusions the Fund draws from Shiller’s work are the weakest tea imaginable: encouraging patient capital through moral suasion, while taking no tax or regulatory steps
towards that goal.
26. In some cases, like Japan and South Korea, the protectionist strategies succeeded; in
Latin America, however, they often protected corrupt and incompetent friends of the
government. There’s no guarantee that protectionism can work as advertised, but it’s
hard to find an example of a country that industrialized successfully — including the
U.S. in the late 19th century — without restricting imports.

What is (not) to be done?

After a long critique like this, the author must always be ready for the
question, “OK, so what would you do?” The temptation is to dismiss it
high-mindedly, saying there’s a virtue to critique alone, but that would
look too cowardly.
Before approximating an answer, though, I have to say that reforms of
the financial sphere are nowhere near as easy as is sometimes argued. If
you believe that money and finance are somehow epiphenomenal — of
secondary importance to the real action of production, or bizarre malignancies that have somehow arisen on the economic body over the years
— then the path of action is a lot clearer. But I’ve spent a lot of time arguing that this isn’t the case. While finance is expensive and wasteful, profit
always takes the form of money, capital yearns to be liquid and easily
mobilized, and financial instruments are the means by which ownership
and control are organized. If Negri is right, and he is, that money has the
face of the boss, then taking on money means taking on the boss.
It would be much easier if the populists and Proudhonists were right in
arguing that money and credit are kept artificially scarce, and the generous provision of both would make life profoundly easier for most of us.
But Marx’s critique of Proudhon, like that in the Grundrisse, should chasten every financial reformer. Marx argued that changes in the instrument
of circulation alone do not address the relations of production and distribution, because these relations are embedded in the very notion of money.
The need for money makes workers work and capitalists compete; it’s not
some quantity that comes from outside the economic system, but from
deep within it. To be meaningful, any attack on the money system is an
attack on the prerogatives of ownership and class power.
Instead of socializing capital through taxation or some other form of
expropriation, loose-money dogma simply reduces to a desire for loans
301

WALL STREET

on easy terms. “The notion of crédit gratuit, incidentally, is only a hypocritical, philistine and anxiety-ridden form of the saying: property is theft.
Instead of the workers taking the capitalists’ capital, the capitalists are
supposed to be compelled to give it to them” (Marx 1973, p. 123). Or in
the case of the American populist, compelled to lend it on easy terms.
While it’s certainly the case that the working class is better off with a central bank that targets a 5% unemployment rate than one that targets 6%,
the differences are not that fundamental.
Recently, we’ve seen a growth in calls for local moneys — chits representing labor time that circulate in small towns alongside national money
— most famously the Ithaca Hours scheme in that town in upstate New
York. Prospects for such schemes seem severely limited; at best, they seem
applicable to haircuts, but probably not scissors, and certainly not raw
steel. As soon as exchange breaks beyond the merely local, capitalist competition is certain to replace egalitarianism as the price-setting principle
unless fundamental changes in ownership and the means by which enterprises relate to each other are made. “Labour time cannot directly be
money…precisely because in fact labour time always exists only in the
form of particular commodities” (Marx 1973, p. 168). The product of a
barber can’t be exchanged with that of an steelworker; they exchange as
haircuts and metal, priced inevitably in money. The form of that money —
Ithaca Hours, Federal Reserve notes, or electronic blips — may not be as
important as people think.
So any call for financial transformations has to be considered only as a
part of a broader attack on the forms of capitalist social power. As this is
written, that seems almost unimaginable. What once seemed like mild
social reforms — even the bare minimal aspects of a social democratic
welfare state we’ve seen in the U.S. — are viewed by our rulers as an
intolerable trespass on their God-given rights. The intensification of the
attack on the welfare state in the U.S. and Western Europe since 1989 has
made it clear that the boss will grant such concessions only as long as
there’s a credible threat of total expropriation, which is what the USSR, for
all its countless faults, always represented to them. As impossible as expropriation may seem today, it pays to remember the old slogan from
Paris 1968: be practical, demand the impossible.
In lieu of a 10-point recipe for social transformation, I offer a montage
of critique and suggestion. First a look at a very bad idea; then a review of
some mixed ideas; and finally a few more ambitious proposals.
But first, it’s important to remember that not all attempts to rein in glo302

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

balizing finance in the name of the local are politically progressive. Here,
for example, is one writer’s view:
Thus, the task of the state toward capital was comparatively simple and
clear; it only had to make certain that capital remain the handmaiden of the
state and not fancy itself the mistress of the nation. This point of view could
then be defined between two restrictive limits: preservation of a solvent,
national, and independent economy on the one hand, assistance of the
social rights of the workers on the other…. The sharp separation of stock
exchange capital from the national economy offered the possibility of opposing the internationalization of the German economy without at the same
time menacing the foundations of an independent national self-maintenance
by a struggle against all capital. The development of Germany was much
too clear in my eyes for me not to know that the hardest battle would have
to be fought, not against hostile nations, but against international capital.

That was Hitler (1943, pp. 209, 213), in Mein Kampf. One should always
be careful of critiques of finance that stop short of being critiques of capital — especially ones that focus on internationalization as an evil in itself.1
Social Security privatization: a truly horrible idea
Nothing illustrates the severity of the attack on the welfare state better
than the emergence into popular discourse in the U.S. of ideas about privatizing the Social Security system. Until quite recently described as the “third
rail” of American politics — touch it and you die — magazines like Time
and The New Republic and even a commission appointed by a Democratic
president have signed onto a privatization agenda that was once an obsession of the libertarian right. When Barry Goldwater suggested in 1964
that Social Security be made voluntary, it was considered evidence of his
madness; now, the National Bureau of Economic Research publishes howto papers (Kotlikoff 1995), and the media are doing the important work of
selling the plan to the public.
Since the idea probably couldn’t be sold on its merits — why destroy a
system that is universal, successful, and deeply popular? — it has to be
sold deviously. At the core of the deception is the line that the system
faces inevitable bankruptcy when the Baby Boomers begin retiring about
10 or 20 years into the next century. The official source of these projections is the annual reports of the Trustees of the Social Security System
(Board of Trustees, Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disabil303

WALL STREET

ity Insurance Trust Funds 1995). As is common with such official efforts,
the Trustees present three sets of projections, a gloomy one, an optimistic
one, and a supposedly moderate one. Though there are a host of interrelated assumptions involved in each, the salient fact, buried in the report’s
tables, is that the Trustees assumed an economic growth rate over the
next 75 years of 1.4% (down from 1.5% in the 1994 annual report) — half
the rate seen in the previous 75 years, and a rate matched in only one
decade in this century (1910–1920). Even the 1930s saw a faster growth
rate (1.9%).2 My own simulations, using higher growth rates, show that
with more reasonable growth assumptions — even a modest 2.0% growth
rate, below the 2.3% average that prevailed between 1973 and 1995 — the
system is not facing insolvency. So either the Trustees are using deliberately bearish growth assumptions to promote public doubt of the system
(a charge the System’s actuary, Steve Goss, strongly denies), or are foreseeing 75 years of depression ahead of us. Big news, either way.
Brokers and insurance companies are taking conscious advantage of
this uncertainty surrounding Social Security to try to snag new accounts.
Adman Bill Westbrook told the Village Voice’s Leslie Savan (1996) that his
research found that the growing public distrust of government meant a
growing “distrust that institutions like Medicaid or Social Security will be
there to take care of people.” His research also disclosed “a growing sense
of empowerment, the idea that I’m a smart, capable person, and I can
make my own decisions.” Thus did Westbrook’s agency, Fallon McElligott,
come up with the “Be Your Own Rock” slogan for its client, Prudential, a
company that, even as the new slogan was unleashed on the world, was
under investigation in 30 states for “widespread deceptive sales practices,
including misleading consumers about the cost of the policies” and “churning” of policies to generate new premiums and commissions (Scism 1996).
It’s all very surreal: the financial markets, characterized by nothing if not
volatility and scandal, are portrayed as rock solid, and government, which
has paid its pensioners without interruption and minimal scandal for over
60 years, is seen as wobbly.
The privatizers’ model is the Chilean pension system, a creation of General Augusto Pinochet’s Chicago-school dictatorship. The model, touted
by both the Cato Institute and the World Bank, is centered on a kind of
compulsory IRA scheme, in which all covered employees put 10% of their
earnings into one of several approved mutual funds, which invest their
holdings in the stock and bond markets. (Employers were relieved of having to make a contribution.) The infusion of money has done wonders for
304

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

the Chilean stock market, but projections are that as many as half of future
retirees will draw a poverty-level pension. For those at the low end, there
remains a minimal public pension check, which offers recipients the
equivalent of under $2 a day (Collins and Lear 1995; Paul and Paul 1995;
Frank Solowey, personal communication).
Though proponents love to advertise “efficiencies” of privatized systems, the Chilean system is hardly a model. The competing mutual funds
have vast sales forces, and the portfolio managers all have their vast fees.
All in all, administrative costs for the Chilean system are almost 30% of
revenues, compared to well under 1% for the U.S. Social Security system.
Even the 12–14% average administrative costs for the U.S. life insurance
industry look efficient by comparison (Diamond 1993).
Finally, the economics of a privatized system, which is inevitably centered on plowing money into the stock market, are pretty dodgy. When
questioned, flacks from the libertarian Cato Institute — which is advised
by the former Chilean cabinet minister who guided the transformation —
make two points: the historical returns on stocks are higher than the implied return on Social Security, and money put into the stock market will
promote real investment. As we’ve already seen, financial theory can’t
explain stock returns very well (the equity premium puzzle), and virtually
no money put into the stock market goes into real investment. When confronted with these details, Cato’s flacks sputter and mutter, but they have
no solid answer other than to denounce the managerial skills of “government bureaucrats.” Flacks also profess great faith in the public’s ability to
manage its retirement portfolio, but even people with advanced degrees
don’t really understand the basic arithmetic of interest rates, much less the
complexities of modern financial markets.
It’s a mystery why the stock market should do any better at solving the
demographic problem of Baby Boomer retirement than the public system. Over the long term, the stock market should grow roughly in line
with the overall economy; the only way it could greatly exceed the underlying growth rate is if the profit share of GDP were to increase continuously, or valuations were to grow to Ponzi-like levels. Historical return
figures — one of the privatizers’ favorite arguments — assume that dividends and capital gains are re-invested, when in fact they will be drawn
down to finance peoples’ retirements; for financing retirement, the stock
market is like a giant revolving fund, much like the public system, that
finances net sales by one set of parties with fresh purchases by another.
Were the Boomers to start selling stocks to finance their retirement, prices
305

WALL STREET

would fall unless there was even more coming in from Generations X, Y,
and Z. And of course any time between now and then, if one has the bad
luck to retire in the midst of a bear market, then he or she may face a fairly
miserable retirement.
But the whole notion of private pension funds, either of the sort that
prevail now or would prevail under a privatized system, depends on an
economic illusion. In one of the more profound passages of the General
Theory, Keynes (CW VII, pp. 104–105) made an argument that has been
virtually lost to modern economic thought:
We cannot, as a community, provide for future consumption by financial
expedients but only by current physical output. In so far as our social and
business organisation separates financial provision for the future from physical provision for the future so that efforts to secure the former do not necessarily carry the latter with them, financial prudence will be liable to destroy
effective demand and thus impair well-being….

Individuals may be able to set aside money for the future, but not a society as a whole; a society guarantees its future only by real physical and
social investments. But the financial markets are demanding cutbacks in
both public and private investment in the name of “financial prudence.”
Today, anyone making an argument like Keynes’s at an American Economics Association meeting or on Crossfire would be regarded as insane.
This is why you won’t find anything in this chapter on the “progressive
use” of pension funds. Peter Drucker’s fears of “pension fund socialism”
of the 1970s have realized themselves in the portfolio manager capitalism
of the 1990s — which is no surprise, since it’s quite natural that capital
should appropriate the pooled savings of workers for “management.” The
whole idea of creating huge pools of financial capital should be the focus
of attack, not the uses to which these pools are put. Instead of funding
infrastructure development through creative pension-fund-backed financial instruments, finance it with a wealth tax instead.
The lesson of the Swedish wage-earner funds should be chastening to
pension-fund reformers (Pontusson 1984; 1987; 1992). The funds were
originally conceived by social democratic economists as a scheme for socializing ownership of corporations. In the original mid-1970s proposal,
firms would have been required to issue new shares, in amounts equal to
20% of their annual profits, to funds representing wage-earners as a collective. In the space of a decade or two, these funds would acquire dominant, and eventually controlling, interests in corporate Sweden.
306

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

This idea scandalized business, which launched a great campaign to
discredit it — a task that was greatly simplified by the fact that the funds
never attracted broad popular support. The Social Democrats and the
unions watered the plan down, and a weak version was adopted in the
early 1980s. The funds quickly began behaving like ordinary pension funds;
their managers, in a vain attempt at legitimation, began trading stocks in
an effort to beat the market averages. Eventually, late in the decade, the
wage-earner funds were euthanized.
Why did they fail? For at least two reasons. First, business correctly saw
the initial version as a challenge to capitalist ownership, a reminder that
finance is central to the constitution of a corporate ruling class. And second, they never attracted popular support — essential to any serious challenge to a corporate ruling class — because they were so abstract. As
Pontusson (1992, p. 237) put it, “when collective shareholding funds are
reduced to deciding whether to buy shares in Volvo or Saab,” it’s hard to
muster popular enthusiasm. More direct interventions are required — active public industrial policy and greater worker control at the firm level —
if ordinary people are to get interested. The stock market, on the other
hand, is the home turf of financiers, and any games played on their turf
usually end up being played by their rules.
democratizing the Fed
Financial populists often propose to “democratize the Fed,” opening up
its proceedings to public scrutiny, and making membership on the Board
of Governors into an elective office. Fundamentally, this is a fine idea.
But, in the spirit of this chapter, its limitations have to be acknowledged.
Congress is an elective office, too, and its proceedings are televised in
narcotic detail on C-SPAN, but the body still produces innumerable insults
to democracy. The moneyed and powerful enjoy an access to Congress
that mere citizens lack, a disparity that is well known; why should applying similar standards to the Fed produce any better results — especially
when it comes to the central bank, whose issues are dear to the hearts of
rentiers? The spectacles of Congressional tax-writing and budget-making
don’t offer an inspiring precedent.
Procedure aside, the nature of the central bank may be less important
than the broader institutions in which it is embedded. A comparison with
other countries demonstrates the point. The most independent of the major
central banks is the German Bundesbank (known as “Buba” to its friends);
307

WALL STREET

it does what it pleases with an insouciance that even Alan Greenspan must
envy. The least independent of the European central banks is the Bank of
England; though it began its life in the seventeenth century as a private
institution that served as banker to the state, it was nationalized in 1946 by
the Labour government and still takes policy direction from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Now it must be admitted that Buba has kept interest
rates very high over the past several years, out of fear of the inflationary
consequences of Bonn’s takeover of the former East Germany. Yet over
the long term, by any standard — whether by hardheaded ones like growth
rates and investment levels, or squishy-humanist ones like poverty rates
and income distribution — the German economy has performed far better than the British one for decades.
It would be tempting to conclude from that comparison that maybe an
independent central bank is a pretty good thing after all. But the Bank of
Japan is largely subordinate to the Japanese Finance Ministry, and by the
same standards, tough or soft, Japan’s economy has done far better than
even Germany’s over the long term. So maybe an independent central
bank isn’t such a good thing after all.
Or maybe the importance of the central bank is exaggerated. Unlike
Britain and the United States, which suffer from loosely regulated financial systems and a shoot-from-the-hip stock market mentality, Japan and
Germany have rather tightly regulated systems in which stock markets
play a relatively unimportant role in both investment finance and corporate governance. Compared with these broader financial structures, the
central bank’s (in)dependence isn’t quite so important.
Populist critiques of the Fed tend to concentrate excessively on its autonomous powers while overlooking the influence of the financial markets on the central bankers: the Fed follows interest rate trends as well as
leading them. The 1994 tightening offers a good example. Creditors began selling their bonds, driving up long-term interest rates, several months
before the Fed jacked up the short-term rates in February. They reinforced
the message with repeated cries urging the Fed to tighten. Even after the
Fed began tightening, Wall Street bayed for more. Similarly, Greenspan’s
urging of deficit-cutting on Clinton was done in the name of pleasing the
bond market, a task the new President took to with great public fervor,
despite the private reservations reported by Woodward. Were some reconstructed Fed to shift policy into a permanently stimulative mode, it
would have to face the prospect of a capital strike on the part of creditors;
it might be able to force short-term rates down, but long-term rates could
308

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

rise toward 20%. Any democratization of the Fed that didn’t simultaneously
take on the financial elite would quickly face such a disaster.
Sure, the Fed should be opened up — its secrecy ended; its own finances brought into the general federal budget; its personnel made more
broadly representative in terms of gender, race, and class; and its narrow,
austere criterion of economic management put on permanent furlough.
But that kind of transformation could succeed only as part of a broader
transformation of financial relations.
investing socially
Over the last decade — essentially since the campaign to purge stock portfolios of companies doing business in South Africa started in the early
1980s — we’ve seen an explosion in investment funds devoted to goals
beyond mere profit-maximization. One can trace the movement’s history
back further — to the early 1970s, when some Methodist clergy founded
the Pax World Fund, and two portfolio managers, Robert Schwartz in New
York and Robert Zevin in Boston, started managing money for a few individuals and institutions concerned about where their profits came from
(Kinder, Lyndenberg, and Domini 1992).
Besides South Africa, the principal concerns motivating social investors in the early days were nuclear power and weapons-making. That is,
the founding impulses were to avoid the noxious. In more recent years,
there’s been a growth in the desire to do active good with one’s investments — to foster development in poor communities, for example, or
fund environmentally friendly technologies. The unifying feature of social
investing (SI) is the desire to accomplish some social goals along with
making a return on one’s money.

screens
As might be expected, the field is populated by a full range of people,
from cynics looking for a market niche to some fine people looking to
transform the world. The mainstream of the SI industry is characterized by
some form of social screening. The flavor of that screening can be sampled
in an ad in the May–June 1995 issue of the Utne Reader for Working Assets, the SI mutual fund giant. Working Assets touted its No-Load Citizens
Index Fund thus: “Unlike the S&P 500, however, we have a low concentration in dirty, dying industries like heavy equipment, oil and chemicals,
weapons, utilities, alcohol and tobacco. Instead, we’ve concentrated on
309

WALL STREET

clean industries of the future, such as communications, consumer products and services, business equipment, high-tech, finance, healthcare and
food production.” While every individual company is socially screened,
the economic analysis underlying this portfolio selection remains happily
unexamined. Forget that the “dying industries” are generally high-wage,
and the “clean industries” often less so. And where would communications, business equipment, and other high-tech industries be without the
chemicals used in the manufacture of computer hardware, and the lowwage labor exploited in the process? Don’t the products of the high-tech
industries contribute to the constant cheapening of labor and the muchlamented globalization of the assembly line? Where would any of these
glistening industries be without the electricity produced by the nasty oilpowered utilities, or the earth moved and the concrete poured by the
products of the heavy equipment industry? Would upper-middle-class
Americans, Working Assets’ target population, have incomes 50 times the
Third World average if it weren’t for all those nasty weapons? Doesn’t
food production profit nicely from the constant cheapening of raw agricultural commodities, a trend that has savaged Third World exporting nations and indigenous producers?3 Isn’t it the cheapest sort of moral bombast
to get exercised by tobacco production, one that induces a warm glow in
the weed-o-phobe, but involves no significant challenge to the social order? And what service does finance offer except the multiplication of riches
for those already blessed with plenty?
But the social investors are, in large measure, part of that financial industry — one that skims the cream, from both the moral and niche marketing points of view, but one that nonetheless never troubles itself with
the larger questions of why some have financial assets while most don’t,
or, more radically, how that translates into the power of creditor over debtor,
and why some should profit from the disguised labor of others.
In an interview broadcast on May 9, 1995 on CNBC, the cable TV business news channel, Sophia Collier, the big cheese at Working Assets, said
that 40% of the S&P 500 stocks are “socially responsible.” That assumes
that you have no problem with the giant multinational corporation itself,
just some individual malefactors. The leading index of socially responsible stocks, that published by Kinder, Lyndenberg, and Domini, includes
about half the S&P 500, presumably the same firms Collier had in mind.
The political thinking of mainstream SI is underdeveloped. In its pragmatic faith in individual action, it’s classically American. Social investors
also make some odd alliances. An issue of The Greenmoney Journal (1995)
310

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

approvingly quoted mutual fund kingpin (Sir) John Templeton reflecting
on ethics, unaware of or indifferent to the fact that his Templeton Prize for
Progress in Religion in 1994 went to Michael Novak, famous for his various theological apologias for Reaganomics, nuclear weapons, and
Argentina’s dirty war against dissidents (Henwood 1994b) — a prize
awarded by a board that included distinguished ethicist Margaret Thatcher.
A contradiction no social screen can address is that investment profits
originate ultimately, no matter how you dress them up, in the uncompensated labor of workers, and that they depend on a social order in which
some people have money to spare and others don’t. When asked to comment on this, the former radical academic turned social broker Michael
Moffitt conceded, “It’s a problem.” Moffitt’s past makes him aware of “the
problem,” but most social investors don’t even think about it.
With South Africa no longer an issue, the most popular social screens
reflect the concerns of upscale liberals: tobacco, women in the boardroom, animal testing, and the grosser environmental crimes. Concerns like
women on the assembly line, unionization, and workplace injuries rarely
appear. One of the favorite stocks of mainstream SI has been that of the
Washington Post Co., a fiercely anti-union firm that publishes the daily
journal of record for the DC branch of the status quo.

alternative lending modes
But the SI universe is not all so conventional, and some aspects are experimenting with the actual transformation of property relations. Let’s start
with the conventional and move gradually away from it. Along with the
growth in SI has come an increasing interest in “alternative” financial institutions, like community development banks (CDBs) and loan funds. The
most prominent of the CDBs is the South Shore Bank of Chicago, whose
promoters say it has revived a declining urban neighborhood while turning in a sterling financial performance. It is touted by some as a model for
the free-market era, a private-sector alternative to discredited old social
programs, though Lyndon Comstock, founder of Brooklyn’s Community
Capital Bank, quickly conceded in an interview that a bank, even one
with social goals, is still no substitute for public sector spending.
South Shore, founded in 1973, is the oldest and richest of its kind. It has
attracted talented bankers and lots of outside depositors. If you read its
press, it’s done wonderfully well. In what appears to be the first outside
effort to audit its claims, Benjamin Esty (1995) of the Harvard Business
School found that South Shore’s actual record is less impressive than its
311

WALL STREET

PR. When measured against nearby banks of comparable size, its financial
performance has been fairly underwhelming. That would be fine if it were
accomplishing its social goals, but it appears not to be. When Esty compared social indicators for the South Shore neighborhood with contiguous communities using Census data from 1970, 1980, and 1990, he found
the results to be “decidedly mixed at best.” While unemployment in the
South Shore neighborhood was lower, incomes have fallen more rapidly
than in the neighboring communities; overall, concluded Esty, “South
Shore’s relative performance has been worse than the contiguous neighborhoods.” Now there may be all kinds of problems, methodological and
conceptual, with this comparison, Esty admits, but these results are nonetheless very damaging to the CDB cause.
Closely related to the South Shore model are various nonbank forms of
local lending like community development funds. Though not strictly commercial banks, they too accept money from socially minded investors and
then make loans to fund housing rehabilitation, nonprofit housing development, and small businesses. The industry is still quite small. According
to the National Association of Community Development Loan Funds (1996),
as of the end of 1995, the industry had $108 million in loans outstanding,
and $204 million in capital, a third of the capital permanent and the rest
borrowed. In the nine years after their 1986 birth, NACDLF member funds
financed 56,243 housing units, 73% of them permanently affordable for
low-income residents, and created or preserved 11,313 jobs, 59% of them
for “low-income people,” 51% for women, and 37% for minorities. Their
loan loss experience was an impressive 0.92%.
Of course all these numbers are better than nothing. But so far they
barely register on the national screen. The total number of jobs “created
or preserved” over the entire 10-year history represents less than two days
of normal U.S. employment growth; of houses financed, about 10 days of
normal U.S. housing production.4
And some loans extended under the name of community development
look rather odd indeed. In its 1995 annual report, the Northern California
Community Loan Fund bragged about a $25,000 loan to establish a Ben &
Jerry’s ice cream store in San Francisco “that will train and provide employment for low income youth from San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood.” A sidebar, illustrated with a picture of smiling, freshly employed
teens, claims that “the business supports youth programs in several ways:
job training takes place in the ice cream parlor, while the profits go towards creating new business enterprises to benefit homeless youth.”
312

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

Ben & Jerry’s is a favorite of the soulful capitalism crowd. Unfortunately,
as its own social auditor, the soulful catalog merchant Paul Hawken, admitted in the firm’s 1994 annual report, reality didn’t support the claims
that the Brazil nuts used in B&J’s Rainforest Crunch were harvested by
indigenous people for their benefit:
The label on Ben & Jerry’s Rainforest Crunch Ice Cream gives the impression that the harvest of the nuts benefits indigenous forest peoples. In fact,
the nuts are not harvested or sold by indigenous peoples but by the rubber
tappers of Brazilian and Portuguese ancestry who have worked the forests
for a century. One might ask what constitutes indigenous status and this
might be a minor point if not for the fact that some experts on indigenous
peoples believe that the flow of money to these projects has had a damaging effect on tribal cultures. The influx of cash has created inequities, rivalries, and an appetite for western goods while reducing the attention paid to
the real issue; land ownership. Quoting Indian Unity: “…Our communities’
independence is … weakened as our well-being is made dependent on
western markets…. Selling products is meaningless if we ourselves do not
control the marketing projects and the natural resources, if we ourselves do
not control our lands and have the right to say what we want….” A second
point regarding label accuracy is that the bulk of the nuts used in Rainforest
Crunch have been commercially rather than alternatively sourced.5

These failings are emblematic of the weakness of SI in general: it too easily becomes just another marketing gimmick, while doing little to address
inequities of wealth and power.
In the Third World, similar small-scale lending schemes are proffered
as cures for poverty in places where conventional development has failed.6
The favorite example, the South Shore of the alternative development
crowd, is the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, which offers tiny loans only
to women, who supposedly build businesses with the proceeds and exit
poverty. Grameen has earned glowing reviews, based mainly on its own
testimony and citation of previously published glowing reviews; in fact,
hardly a negative word about the bank appeared anywhere in the press
until Gina Neff investigated Grameen for Left Business Observer (Neff 1996).
Despite claims of poverty reduction, over half of Grameen’s long-term
borrowers can’t meet basic nutritional needs. Despite claims of commercial viability, the enterprise is kept going only by philanthropists’ subsidies. Despite claims of “empowering” women, Grameen loans formalize
women’s informal household labor (while blocking their entry into po313

WALL STREET

tentially more liberating — with all the appropriate qualifications — waged
work), typically without increasing their autonomy within the household
(well under half have significant control over the businesses held in their
names). By contrast, the Self-Employed Women’s Association of India
(SEWA) offers credit, but as part of a package of education and political
organizing. With Grameen, male lending officers really call the shots.
The appeal of microcredit schemes like Grameen — which have been
adopted enthusiastically by the likes of the World Bank, Hillary Clinton,
and Citibank — is that they are a low-cost, nonthreatening substitute for
real self-organization, like SEWA, and for expensive public programs like
education, health care, and infrastructure investment.
It may be that the lesson of the World Bank’s experience over the last
50 years is of near-universal applicability: it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to borrow your way out of poverty.

rethinking property
More promising than New Age banks are strategies that alter the nature of
property relations. For example, community land trusts (CLTs) “are democratically controlled non-profit corporations, with open membership and
elected boards. The purpose of a CLT is to acquire land and hold it permanently for the benefit of the community. The land is then made available
through long-term leases to individual families, cooperatives, and other
organizations who may own buildings on the land. Resale restrictions in
the ground lease keep the property available for future purposes” (Community Investment Monitor 1995). CLTs were developed by the founders
of the Massachusetts-based Institute for Community Economics (ICE), Ralph
Borsodi and Bob Swann, in the 1960s. Lessors on CLT land can be compensated for improvements they make to their building, but they cannot
sell it on the open market; the idea is to remove the parcel of land from
the property market forever. A similar concept, limited equity co-ops, can
be used in cities; residents can buy an apartment from the co-op, and sell
it back when they leave — with appropriate compensation for any improvements they might have made and general inflation, but with no possibility of significant trading profits.
A former director of the ICE, Charles Matthei (personal communcation)
argues that increases in property values are claimed by individuals, but,
aside from improvements made by the occupant, are typically the result
of social action like public infrastructure development or general economic
growth. It’s fundamentally unfair, Matthei says, that these social gains
314

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

should be captured mainly by private individuals — especially unfair if
they contributed little or nothing to their neighborhood’s upscaling except having been there at the right time.
Still, CLTs are a speck on the horizon; as of late 1995, there were only
90 of them in the U.S. The ICE, “a leader among leaders,” according to the
newsletter of the National Association of Community Development Loan
Funds (Community Investment Monitor 1995) had equity capital of
$531,000 and had lent a total of $26 million between its founding in 1979
and 1995. With the total value of land, buildings, and other tangible assets
in the U.S. nearly $20 trillion in 1994, according to the Fed’s flow of funds
accounts, CLTs have a long, long way to go.
One of the reasons to be skeptical about institutions that don’t alter
property relations is that institutions and people that start out with noble
goals often end up reproducing the ills they were meant to correct. The
U.S. is full of community organizations and nonprofit housing developers
that now seem indistinguishable, except maybe in matters of style, from
conventional real estate developers and banks. It is no accident that the
Ford Foundation has embraced community development schemes; no
institution in America is better at spotting potential troublemakers and
domesticating them (not only in the U.S., but around the world).
taxes: soak the fat boys!
Many of the approaches I’ve just discussed are attempts to craft marketfriendly responses to social problems. They’re often represented as fresh
approaches to old problems, when in fact they’re really convention tarted
up as innovation. I’m reminded of Karl Kraus’s comment about psychoanalysis — that it’s the disease of which it purports to be the cure.
If old thinking can be successfully passed off as new, why not revive
some better old ideas than the ones now being re-animated? Capital controls, for example, once a cornerstone of social democratic thinking, are
now dismissed as hopelessly obsolete. But why? Why not require government approval of inbound and outbound foreign investment? It worked
quite well for Japan and South Korea; why can’t capital controls be put in
service of an agenda more humane than the rapid growth in GDP and
exports? To those who say that modern technology makes it easy to evade
such restrictions one can easily reply that it also makes it easier to impose
them. The principal obstacles aren’t technical, but political (not that the
political obstacles are minor).
315

WALL STREET

Perhaps the most unfashionable idea of all is taxing the rich — or soaking the fat boys, as Jack Burden, the journalist turned political consultant,
put it to Willie Stark, the Huey Long-ish hero of Robert Penn Warren’s All
the King’s Men. Seriously boosting the income tax rate on the richest 1–
2% of the population could fund all manner of public programs, from free
education and childcare to public jobs programs. And taxation of wealth
itself, along with income, would be a wonderful way to raise funds for,
say, the upgrading of the public physical and social capital stock — financing urban reconstruction, mass transit, alternative energy research,
and environmental repair. Both forms of taxation would also have the
lovely side-effect of reducing the wealth and social power of the very rich.
Income taxes are familiar, but wealth taxes aren’t. Washington taxes
wealth only on the death of the very wealthy, and even then estate taxes
are quite porous, and are often referred to as “voluntary,” because anyone
with time and a clever lawyer can pretty much dodge them.
As of 1990, eleven OECD countries, all in Europe, had some form of
wealth taxation in effect, although the burden on the well-off was in general quite light. Simulations by Edward Wolff (1995, chapters 8 and 9)
show that adopting the Swiss system of wealth taxation would have raised
$34 billion in 1989; the German system, $68 billion, and the Swedish (since
repealed by a conservative government), $329 billion — in a year when
total revenues from federal income taxes were $446 billion, and the muchbemoaned deficit was $152 billion.
All three models exclude household effects (though not owner-occupied housing) and pensions from wealth taxes, and the German and Swedish versions also spare life insurance. So all three leave the poor and the
middle class largely unscathed. Only a Swedish-style tax would bite the
upper middle class; those with wealth in the $75,000–100,000 range (in
1989) would face a new tax equal to about 15% of their present income
tax; those in the $100,000–250,000 range, 39% of their income tax, and
those above $250,000 would take a hit close to or larger than their present
income tax liability. Obviously such a tax would have very dramatic economic, fiscal, and distributional effects, unlike the other two national
models. A Swiss-style system would be barely noticeable to non-millionaires, and German-style system would hardly touch those with wealth
holdings under $250,000. Even so, the amounts of revenue raised would
be more than notional in an era where public services are starved for funds.
There are few serious arguments against wealth taxes except the preservation of privilege. Wealth taxes would tend to hit older families harder
316

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

than younger ones, even though some older families may have lower incomes than their more youthful fellow citizens, but careful design of the
tax could mitigate these effects if that were desired.7 But of course, a wealth
tax by definition would hit only those with a lot of commas in their bank
balance. Rich folks and their hired pens would no doubt claim very damaging effects on saving and investment, but the U.S., which taxes wealth and
income very lightly, has one of the lowest rates of saving and investment
in the First World — lower than Sweden in the days of its tax. More generally, “there appears to be no strong evidence that the presence of a wealth
tax inhibits savings” (Wolff 1995, p. 54). And, as Wolff points out, the fact
that Switzerland taxes wealth makes capital flight arguments a bit hard to
sustain, since that country is the target, not the source, of a not insignificant share of the world’s flight capital.
Another levy, designed more to change behavior than to raise revenue,
would be to tax securities trading. The idea of a transactions tax to cut
trading volume goes back at least as far as Keynes (CW VII, p. 160), who
drew a contrast between Britain, where brokerage commissions and trading taxes were high, and the U.S., where both were low: “The introduction of a substantial Government transfer on all transactions might prove
the most serviceable reform available, with a view to mitigating the predominance of speculation over enterprise in the United States.” Keynes
further argued that the purchase of a security be made “permanent, and
indissoluble, like marriage, except by reason of death or other grave cause.”
Nowadays, of course, marriages are dissolved for reasons other than death
or grave cause, and few civilized people would argue that divorce be made
as difficult as it was 60 years ago. But if you believe that heavy trading
increases the volatility of asset prices and encourages all manner of pointless or malignant financial hyperactivity, then transactions taxes are a simple
but potentially powerful remedy. It’s not the euthanasia of the rentier exactly, but it’s the first prick of the fatal needle.
Stock trading costs in the U.S. for large institutional investors are the
lowest of any major market by a considerable margin. According to 1992
data from Frank Russell Securities (cited in Campbell and Froot 1994),
U.S. traders paid 0.30% of the value of a transaction in commissions and
fees, or 30 basis points (bp) in market jargon; next-cheapest was Britain,
at 50 bp; in other markets, the figure was 60 bp or higher. In addition,
eight of the 10 countries imposed taxes or other fees on top of the brokers’ take. British taxes were equal to another 50 bp, making the cost of
moving a share of stock from one set of hands to another more than three
317

WALL STREET

times as expensive as the U.S. So, not only does the U.S. have the world’s
largest capital market, it also has the cheapest.
Transactions taxes are easier to impose than collect, because investors
will do everything they can to avoid paying them. They and their bankers
will invent new instruments not covered in the tax, or discover loopholes,
or move their trading abroad. If they can’t evade the tax, they will cut back
on trading. That’s not necessarily a bad thing; the aim of a transactions tax
is to change behavior as much as it is to raise revenue. But achieving both
goals requires that the tax be carefully designed.
One thing is clear: a transactions tax must be levied on the traders, not
the trade; on the transaction, not the specific security. As Campbell and
Froot show, a Swedish tax on brokerage services was easily avoided by
doing trades in London and New York. But the U.K.’s transactions tax was
levied on changes in ownership, making it very difficult for British investors to avoid. Similarly, local taxes on the New York or Pacific Stock Exchanges, which have been proposed by troublemakers on both coasts,
could be very easily evaded, but a national tax on U.S. resident buyers
and sellers couldn’t be. A tax on stocks alone could be avoided through
trading options; a tax on registered securities could be evaded with custom over-the-counter deals; a tax based on legal domicile could be avoided
by moving the legal headquarters to a taxless Caribbean isle. For once,
clever lawyers could do something socially useful by drafting the transactions tax to foreclose those dodges.
A broad, well-designed tax could raise not insignificant amounts of
money. Dean Baker, Robert Pollin, and Marc Schaberg (1994) estimated
that, based on 1992 trading figures, a modest tax of 50 bp on stock sales, a
1 bp per year to maturity tax on bonds (so that a 30-year bond would be
subject to a 30 bp tax), and comparable rates on derivatives could raise
$60 billion a year assuming no decline in trading, or $30 billion if trading
fell by half. That would still leave the costs of trading stocks well below
British levels, and Britain is not known as a place where the financial
sector is underdeveloped. Baker et al. admirably proposed that the proceeds of the tax be used to finance education, military-to-civilian conversion, and environmental research and repair.
More modestly, James Tobin (1995) has proposed a 0.5% tax on international currency transactions, to dampen exchange market volatility.
People transacting real-world business would find the tax negligible, but
those trying to profit from every quiver of every exchange rate would be
inconvenienced. (If 0.5% isn’t a high enough rate to do the trick, then it
318

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

should be whatever’s required to accomplish the task.) Tobin would tax
only spot market transactions, exempting derivatives, arguing that prices
are set in spot markets, and derivatives prices only reflect, they don’t shape,
the course of spot prices — though he admits that he’s not fully sure of
this.8 Aside from dampening volatility, Tobin also would like to restore
more national discretion to economic policymaking. “I am not one,” said
Tobin, “who thinks that the markets are always imposing upon any central bank exactly the discipline it ought to have.” Markets, through ignorance, perverseness, or delusion, can impose policies on countries that
are inappropriate to national circumstances, and Tobin thinks his tax might
reduce this pressure. Attempts to evade the tax, he argued, could be managed by having it administered by the IMF — even making compliance
with the tax a condition of membership. Proceeds of the tax could be
used for “worthwhile international purposes” — funding the UN, the World
Bank, and the IMF, for example. The latter institutions have contributed
greatly to creating the borderless world Tobin bemoans, but liberals rarely
seem to have problems with contradictions like this.
Tobin has also argued for a similar tax on stock trades. Tobin lodged a
dissent from the tame official recommendations of the Twentieth Century
Fund’s (1992) Task Force on Market Speculation and Corporate Governance. The report’s centerpiece was a long essay by Robert Shiller (1992)
on markets’ excessive volatility, and the dangers of taking guidance on
how to run real corporations from movements in their stock prices. But
having raised that interesting question, the worthies on the Fund’s panel
decided against a transactions tax, preferring instead a revolution in the
consciousness of institutional investors — the sprouting of a new culture
of patience and self-discipline, as incredible as that may sound to any
student of the markets. Over half the worthies were from finance, law, or
the Fed; the balance were mainly safe academics. Nonfinancial corporations were conspicuously absent. Tobin wrote, politely, that the “Task Force
was wrong to give such short shrift to ‘sand in the wheels’ of the financial
markets” (Twentieth Century Fund 1992, p. 23). Tobin never reflects on
what social purpose shareholders serve — but if he were the kind to do
that, the Twentieth Century Fund would never have had him on their panel.
Few things, aside from the threat of direct appropriation of their property, make Wall Streeters scream more loudly than the assertion that their
pursuits are pointless or malignant, and that their activities should be taxed
like a noxious effluent. Listening to those screams would be another positive benefit of a transactions tax.

refusing money
More radical than taxation is what Harry Cleaver (1995) has called “the
subversion of money-as-command.” If, as Marx held (and Negri emphasized), money and credit are forms of social power — and debt and fiscal
crises are used to intensify the force of capitalist rule — then the refusal of
that relation would strike sharply at the orthodox order. Cleaver argued
that Keynesian welfare state policies, through their excessive generosity,
reduced the capitalists’ power and increased that of the working class;
rising wages and benefits during the Golden Age also contributed to this.
Among the virtues of this line of analysis are that it politicizes apparently
technical aspects of budget-making, and clarifies the importance of the
New York fiscal crisis in introducing the era of capitalist counterattack —
still in full swing as these words are written more than 20 years later.
Restoring the welfare state is one line of action — a bit boring, perhaps,
but essential to any more radical projects, since nothing boosts the freedom of maneuver for nonelites like a hospitable safety net. A more radical
version of the subversion of money is the organized, political refusal to
pay debts, a technique that was used with great success in South Africa
during the final assault on apartheid. It’s hard to imagine the American
masses, energized with revolt, collectively scrawling “Non serviam” across
their VISA bills, but stranger things have happened.
transforming corporations
Finally, since most of this book is about the securities of large private
corporations, that’s where this chapter should conclude. The long-term
goal should be to reduce the financial and governance role of the stock
market with an eye towards its eventual elimination. Corporations should
be placed increasingly under a combination of worker, community, customer, supplier, and public control. Of course, it’s easy to say that in a
reasonable-sounding sentence or two, but the actual task, technically and
politically, would be difficult as hell.9
The present fashion for putting more outside directors on boards, in
the name of “independent” supervision, rules out union representatives,
who are considered insiders (Blair 1995, p. 81). It also rules out firms’
significant suppliers and customers. This is the opposite of Japanese governance structure, with their elaborate cross-holdings and monitoring.
That Japanese structure, with its cross-holding and monitoring mecha-

320

WHAT IS (NOT) TO BE DONE?

nisms, seems like a promising model for a more socialized mode of ownership of larger firms (smaller ones could be run as cooperatives). Instead
of a bank at the center run on profit principles, one could easily imagine a
publicly owned one, run on social principles; various socialized groups
would be organized around various publicly owned banks, operating under
a broad, publicly drawn macroeconomic plan. The banks would collect
money from individuals and institutions with spare balances, and lend
them at low rates of interest to enterprises in their constituencies. Depositors, then, would be paid interest on the basis of these earnings. Firms
would be governed by boards representing all these constituencies, with
the bank exercising long-term supervision. The banks themselves would
be answerable to a central bank, which would provide funds and direct
investment according to democratically agreed on priorities. The need for
outside stockholders, who provide little or no capital and less good advice, would be eliminated.
I realize that this prescription — something like market socialism — is
at once spotty and grandiose. But the point is not to provide an elaborate
blueprint for a future society, in the style of John Roemer. Off-the-shelf
utopias may be useful thought experiments, but they’re of limited political use, except maybe as long-term inspiration. A future society has to
emerge out of this one, on the basis of experimentation and struggle. I’ve
outlined the fundamental principles of where I think we should go. Consider these closing pages fragments of a first draft for a project aiming to
end the rule of money, whose tyranny is sometimes a little hard to see.
notes
1. Obviously, capitalist internationalization, as practiced by multinational corporations, is
something to be criticized. But purely localist critiques that view cosmopolitanism itself as dangerous are tinged with xenophobia, and frequently sentimentalize pre-existing local hierarchies out of existence.
2. One rationale sometimes offered for the slow growth rates is that the labor force will
grow more slowly over the next seven decades than it has over the past seven; this is
precisely the reason offered by the Trustees and the System’s actuary, Steve Goss. The
economic evidence is, however, that a slowdown in labor force growth will be offset
by an increase in productivity growth (Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers 1990).
Cutler et al. also argue that an aging population is a reason for a lower savings rate
rather than a higher one — the exact opposite of conventional advice.
3. This is not to argue that modernization is necessarily bad and that indigenous production methods should remain unchanged for all time. But those willing to profit off the
trend while basking in moral superiority should take some notice of the contradiction.
4. The NACDLF began lending in 1986. Between the end of 1985 and the end of 1995,

321

there was a net growth of 19.6 million jobs in the U.S., an average of 164,000 per month,
or about 8,000 per business day. Over the same period, housing starts averaged 1.4
million a year, or 5,700 per business day.
For more on Ben & Jerry’s, and the failings of socially responsible business in general,
see the fine series of articles by Jon Entine cited in the bibliography. Entine’s first claim
to fame was his exposure of the fraud behind the Body Shop, another darling of the
tender commerce crowd.
Failed, that is, if you think the goal of development is the emergence of poor countries
from poverty. If the goal of “development” is to extract resources, money, and labor
from the world’s poor, then development has been quite successful.
Social scientists love to speak of the “intergenerational transmission of welfare dependency” — the likelihood of welfare moms having daughters who themselves become
welfare moms. They are less interested in studying the intergenerational transmission
of privilege, but a sharp wealth tax would go a long way to reducing that elite form of
dependency.
Since spot and derivatives markets are now so intertwined, it’s hard to imagine how
they could be treated so differently for tax purposes. And if the aim is to change behavior as well as raise revenue, the exemption makes no sense at all.
This is not to say that Hilferding’s idea that seizing a few big banks in the name of the
people would lead to socialism was right. Relations within enterprises (i.e., genuine
worker control) and relations between enterprises (meaning planned linkages that replace market/competitive ones) must also be transformed.

As with the graph on the previous page, the long-term rate is that on railroad bonds
from1857 to 1917; after 1917, it’s the average rate on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
“Real” rate is computed by subtracting the yearly change in the consumer price index
from the nominal rate. Periods are based on Angus Maddison’s (1995): the period of
high Victorian capitalism — of the gold standard, the British empire, and free trade and
free capital flows (1870–1913); the periods of war, troubled recovery, depression, more
war, and a less troubled recovery (1914–1949); the postwar Golden Age (1950–73);
and the recent Bronze Age. I’ve divided the recent period into the years of inflation,
labor and Third World rebellions, and U.S. imperial erosion (1974–81), and the period
since, that of more assertive imperial power, consolidated financier rule, and free trade
and free capital flows.

These charts try to show the relation between the stock market and the real economy.
On top is a long-term view, showing three-year real (inflation-adjusted) changes in stocks
(the S&P 500 index) and GDP. The stock market more or less follows economic trends
— it’s hardly infallible as a leading indicator — and often overdoes it in both directions.
The tendency to overreact is more visible in the second chart, which plots year to year
changes in quarterly averages. For the post-World War II U.S., the market leads the
economy by about two quarters, but is still no match for the yield curve as a leading
indicator (see p. 122).

Real total returns for stocks and bonds are computed from index
numbers representing cumulative real total return (that is, interest
and dividends are reinvested). For stocks, the index number is equal
to the sum of a year’s dividend yield plus price change (expressed
as a percent) less the inflation rate (consumer price index) times
the prior year’s index, or
Index =Index
y

X (1+DividendYield +PriceChange +CPI )].
y-1

For bonds, the index equals a year’s average interest payment plus
price return (on a bond normalized so that an 8% yield is priced at
100) less the change in CPI. Of course, taxes and transaction costs
would make it near-impossible to duplicate these measures; they
represent not an actual portfolio’s performance, but the comparative tendencies over time. Source: National Bureau of Economic

Bibliography

For conciseness’ sake, economic and other social statistics derived from standard official
sources are not cited in the text. For the U.S., the standard sources for “real sector” data are
the national income and product accounts, as published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce; the BEA’s monthly journal, Survey of Current
Business; the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Department of Labor; the BLS’s monthly
journals, the Monthly Labor Review and Employment and Earnings; and the Bureau of the
Census, U.S. Department of Commerce. U.S. government budget data comes principally
from the Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1999: Historical Tables. For
U.S. financial sector data, the principal source is the statistical annex to the monthly Federal
Reserve Bulletin and the Annual Statistical Digest. When a source is given as the Federal
Reserve’s Flow of Funds accounts, this refers to the Fed’s periodicals Balance Sheets for the
U.S. Economy (C.9 series, biannual) and Flow of Funds: Flows and Outstandings (Z.1 series, quarterly). International data come principally from the International Monetary Fund’s
International Financial Statistics (yearbook and monthly updates) and Balance of Payments Statistics (yearbook); the World Bank’s World Development Report and World Tables,
both published annually; and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s serial Economic Outlook, published twice a year, and its companion historical volume. In most cases, data comes from electronic versions of these printed sources: from the
Commerce Department’s Economic Bulletin Board, various U.S. government web sites (especially those of the Fed and the BLS), and the WEFA database on Dialog. Statistics drawn
from other sources are fully referenced. In almost all cases, the data are the latest available
as of April 1, 1998.
